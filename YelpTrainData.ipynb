Waited 45 minutes for a table but it was worth the wait. Got the Euro Burger which was a Gordon Ramsay burger with goats cheese, arugula, truffle aioli and roasted tomatoes. So freakin good! You should eat here if you're in the area or you're missing out.\",\n",

       " \"The food is 5 stars all the way... so yummy! Our experience was only 2 star service. Over all, a 3.5 star review.\\n\\nAs a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, we'd been anxious to try this place. With Mom in town it seemed like the perfect occasion. We went at a sort of off time (3:00 in the afternoon) so we got in and were seated right away. All of the food around us lookd delicious so I could not wait to take my first bite.\\n\\nI ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14) as did Mom. I ordered mine medium, she ordered hers well done with no tomatoes. The bf ordered The Farm Burger ($15) and we shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11).\\n\\nMy burger was perfect! So tasty and super spicy from the jalapenos. The bf's burger was even better (we shared), which was a relief because I was worried about how the duck breast bacon would taste. The fries were equally delicious, with just the right amount of truffle flavor. Unfortunately Mom's burger came out bloody pink inside when she'd ordered it well done. I thought at fist they must have mixed up our burgers but then realized she had asked for no tomatoes and mine had them so that wasn't the case at all. Mom was polite and ate 1/2 of her burger without complaining. When she refused to eat the other half because it was rare I decided to say something. I pulled the waitress over and told her, she had not been attentive up to this point, we'd even had to flag down someone else for refills on our drinks. She didn't take any responsibility for the mistake and said she'd have a manager come talk to us. A manager never came by and eventually she returned with our bill. I then asked to speak to a manager, at which point she said she took the burger off the bill. Ok fine.\\n\\nI paid, and I tipped off of the price of the entire meal before the burger had been removed, even though I didn't really want to. After she returned to pick up the check we asked about the prices in the menu, why most everything showed one price and then next to it a dollar less. She explained that with a PH rewards card we saved a dollar on each item... would have been nice if she'd told us anytime before we'd already paid. We whipped our card out and she returned with $3... that would have been $3 less I would have tipped on. Whatever..\\n\\nI hope if we ever return again the experience is far better.\",\n",

       " \"Very solid for the price.  I like to rate things relative to others in a similar price category.\\n\\nThe burgers were very good, the standard fries were pretty bad. They were limp and with odd condiments in lieu of ketchup, which neither of us enjoyed.  They were bad enough that I considered sending them back but I didn't feel like making a fuss.  The drink I ordered was one of the best specialty drinks I've ever had and the dessert (the creme brûlée & Oreo cookie shake) was positively incredible.  Our server was a little more aggressive than I like, but was good at his job. All in all, worth coming back for.\",\n",
       " \"A popular burger restaurant in Las Vegas located inside Planet Hollywood. There is always a lineup outside Gordon Ramsay's Burgr as they don't take reservations. The restaurant is huge and has lots of tables but it is also one of the Gordon's more popular restaurants. Burgers are under $20 so not too bad of a pricepoint for top quality burger. I've dined here a few times and I was back again. This time, I ordered the Hog Burger which has mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, vintage white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion and slaw. The waiter gave up a heads up that the wait for the food was 45 minutes and considering how busy the restaurant was, it was expected. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries. The burger was quite delicious and was cooked perfectly. The pork patty was moist and juicy which is just the way I like it. Everyone usually orders the fries which is quite good topped with truffle parmesan, salt and aioli. If you are a big Ramsay fan like I am and enjoy great burgers, this restaurant is the place to be. Our dining experience was quite enjoyable and service was great. My friends and I were quite satisfied and full from dinner. Highly recommend this place when you visit Vegas!\",\n",

With fries, soda, burger, tax+tip, my order alone came out to about $40 give or take because I wanted to go for the truffle fries, which are great. It's definitely over hyped and over priced for the burger, fries, and soda. I will still be willing to go over and try another burger on the menu, although I probably would not casually eat here since I feel like I get better burgers for that amount at other places.\",\n",

Kinda dull and dry, we both had to add condiments which at an establishment like this I was a little disappointed. \\nYou can tell either Chef Gordan really cares or the GM cares about the \"nice looking\" staff because I noticed how the employees were all very good looking. \\nLunch was pricy, plan on $100 for 2 people. It was a good lunch, but I don\\'t need to return.',\n",

The farm burger has an excellent, savory flavor with the duck breast bacon and the oozy, tasty fried egg.

The hostesses were just chatting with each other while the people in line were wondering why they weren't seating us when there was visible open seats.\\n\\nWith open seats at the bar a guy by himself just walked up to the hostess and asked if he could sit down and they said sure so that pissed off us and the couple behind us. We immediately complained and were seated at the bar.\\n\\nFood options were pretty simple.  We ordered:\\n\\n- Truffle Parmesan Fries\\n- Euro Burger\\n- Hog Burger\\n\\nFood took forever but when it finally arrived it didn't disappoint.

One of my gals had already been here once before and said it was very good so we had pretty high expectations. Plus, I love Gordon Ramsay and watch everything and anything that he has done on television. \\n\\nLuckily, we didn\\'t have to wait for a table because I had a platinum total rewards card. The line was reeeeeally long and to be honest, if we did have to wait I would have been pissed.\\n\\nOur waitress seemed nice but it was impossible to hear her even though the restaurant wasn\\'t very loud. Throughout our meal she was replaced by several different staff members so it got somewhat confusing. Different people would bring out our food and then other people would get our drinks which made it feel like a disorganized mess. \\n\\nFood was ok but totally not worth the hype or price tag. \\n\\nOnions rings - good crunch but very greasy\\nJalapeno poppers - probably the best thing we had, but I\\'m pretty sure they forgot our \"fiery surprise\"\\nFrench fries - decent, but could have used more salt and longer cook time\\n\\nI had the American burger because I was not feeling very adventurous and I figured it would be the hardest one to screw up. \\n\\nThe bun was good but the burger overall was totally bland. While the cook on the burger was good, the meat did not seem seasoned enough at all. Additionally, there is no condiment on this burger which made for a completely flavorless experience. No fancy ketchup, no \"secret sauce\" aioli, not even a basic mustard. Nothing! You\\'d think they would want to put something like that on an \"American burger\"..? Or maybe that\\'s just me.\\nWhile I liked that they used sweet pickles instead of dill, that was about the most stand out thing for me. \\n\\nMy husband felt the same way about his bleu cheese burger. Not enough flavor and just overall extremely unimpressive from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. \\n\\nWe also got the sticky toffee pudding push up pops which were, in short, disgusting. \\nThe cake was extremely dry and crumbly with a flavor reminiscent of burnt molasses rather than nice toffee. The salted peanut ice cream was decent but seemed completely out of place with the other flavor. For me, the two did not meld well at all. I didn\\'t finish mine. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure how this place consistently gets lines over 10 people deep, but I definitely won\\'t be back. Super Meh. \\n\\nI\\'d sooner return to Stripburger (or even Carl\\'s Jr. for that matter...sorry GR!)',\n",

       " 'This review will reflect our recent visit on 10/21/14 as well as one other visit about a year prior.\\n\\nHaving been to a few of Gordon\\'s restaurants (Maze in NYC, BurGR in Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas) one thing I notice every time is the consistency of both service and quality.  There has never been a hiccup.  You can tell that he demands a certain level of service and thankfully it is carried out 100% of the time.\\n\\nBurGR is set in a casual location near the front of Planet Hollywood casino, just off of the strip.  The decor is cool and hip, with an open plan...big TVs surrounding the dining room, and a clear view from all seats back to the kitchen.\\n\\nThe service, as mentioned, is top notch.  You are greeted warmly by everyone you encounter, and even though this is a \"burger joint\" kind of feel, the staff is on a 5 star restaurant level.\\n\\nThe food is as awesome as you anticipate.  We\\'ve had a few different burgers here...the Hell\\'s Kitchen (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avacado, oven roasted tomato)...the American (american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion)...and the Chanterelle (chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam)...as well as the truffle parmesan fries (hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli).  My favorite is probably the Hell\\'s Kitchen, but you know you\\'re eating an incredible burger when you get a simple American style and it tastes amazing.  Everything was cooked to perfection (medium...even though the chef recommends medium rare) and the buns are as tasty as you can get.\\n\\nFor desert, we\\'ve had the sticky pudding pops twice.  This is a tough one to review.  If you haven\\'t had his normal sticky toffee pudding, you\\'ll love these pops!!  They are fun, delicious and a cool twist on a classic.  However, if you\\'ve had his REAL sticky toffee pudding (with that salted caramel ice cream that comes in the shape of a butter stick) you might be a bit disappointed!  But hey..his original sticky toffee pudding is the BEST dessert you can get, period. (Seriously..it\\'s worth a trip to the bar at Gordon Ramsay Steak just to order it)\\n\\nAnyway, Gordon delivers the goods here at BurGR.  The prices are in line with the food quality (burgers are in the 13-15 range) and the experience is top notch.  You simply cannot go wrong.',\n",
       " 'It was a 30-minute wait (give them your cell # and they\\'ll text you when the table is ready).  There were three of us.  We ordered the American (me), Euro (person #2), and the Farm (person #3).   Also ordered a side of parm fries and onion rings.  The verdict?  Good, but not \"WOW that\\'s a juicy mother of a burger!\"  The curry ketchup was the highlight for me, but that can\\'t be good when ketchup steals the show.  The onion rings were better than the fries.  As for the burgers... the Farm was the best.',\n",
       " \"If this is what a Krabby Patty tastes like, then I have finally found it. Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had! My boyfriend agrees as well! Although there was a wait, I was actually kind of expecting it, because well, it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! I love the decor, there's a large fire display, and there's a nice, hip vibe to the restaurant. The greeter was very sweet and polite, and it was maybe a 30 minute wait for the two of us. Our server, I think his name was Matt (he mentioned he worked since the opening of the restaurant) was great! He was friendly, and very polite. \\nAlthough the food took a while to come out, the wait was well worth it. We ordered two burgers, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries. I would recommend the sweet potato fries over the truffle. Burgers were delicious and our experience was great! Would definitely come back when we go to Las Vegas.\",\n",
       " 'Food is great. But when line is long their staff seating you expects you to \"help them out\" with extra tipping to get you seated faster. If you don\\'t cough up money, expect the wait to be 1-2 hours on busy night cuz there are people that well. \\n\\nBurger is perfectly balanced and food is awesome. Waiting staff is highly attentive. If they just sort out the seating problem bullshit it would be five stars.',\n",
       " \"You have got to try it and see why Gordon is the master he is. Please do yourself a favor and order the Ramsay burger. It's not on the menu and it's simply the most outstanding burger I've ever eaten. The meat was moist , flavorful and cooked to perfection and the combination of duck breast bacon, avocado, and onions are to die for. \\n\\nThe staff is extremely friendly and professional. I was very impressed from the moment I walked in to the time I left, and they know the menu. Do yourself a favor and talk to them and ask them for recommendations. You won't regret it. \\n\\nThe only one criticism would be that the truffle fries were a tad too oily, although I still enjoyed them very much and the kitchen got backed up, so I had to wait a little longer than expected, but overall, this is a must try on the strip.\",\n",
       " \"I have watched quite a few episodes of Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen and also Kitchen Nightmares, so having the opportunity to eat at one of his restaurants was pretty exciting. \\nBurgr is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. The atmosphere is great- dim lighting showcasing the fire effects around the restaurant. Burgr does not take reservations, so be prepared to stand in line to wait for a table. However, the wait for a party of 2 was only about ten minutes. Not bad!\\nNow, on to the food. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was amazing! I ordered it medium, and that's just how it was cooked. The roasted tomatoes were a nice change to the traditional sliced, fresh tomato, and added great flavor on addition to the avocado and peppers. My husband ordered the Uber Cheese burger medium rare and enjoyed it as well. If you are thinking about ordering fries, the Parmesan Truffle Fries are a must!! One order is more than enough for 2 people. \\nNow dessert.. For any of you who have watched the UK version of Kitchen Nightmares, you know how much Sticky Toffee Pudding is mentioned. And it just so happens to be on the menu here in the form a push-pop with salted peanut ice cream. Another must-try!\\nMy husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Burgr and are looking forward to our next visit there.\",\n",

Best garlic aioli I've tasted!\\n\\nHubby got the Hell's Kitchen. Delish and just the right amount of spice!\",\n",
       " 'Fuck off - this is one of the best burger joints, ever.\\n\\nTook a few friends and peers to BurGR for lunch. We had everything from the Euro Burger, Cheese Burger to the Hells Kitchen Burger. \\n\\nHells Kitchen by a mile. It is incredible. \\n\\nI would also recommend ordering a ton of their wings, and a couple of baskets of Onion Rings. Forget the fries, they arent crispy, hot or worth it. Just order two Onion Rings - they are like the Wings and Burgers - delicious, crispy and hot. \\n\\nA Las Vegas must-do for me.',\n",
       " 'Not one for long reviews. This place rocks. Onion rings were FANTASTIC. Fries were about an 8 and the burger was maybe 7 1/2 out of 10. Great service and holy crap, the desert.....Oreo Shake was the best.',\n",
       " \"I think the 4 star is pretty justifiable for this restaurant. \\n\\nThe hamburgers are great. It definitely has some twist from your regular burgers. Each burger has something special to it. My first time here, I tried the Euro burger and Farm burger. I know a lot of people love the farm burger, but for me personally it was a little too heavy. I prefer to have some vegetables in my burger as well. Euro burger for me was a better balanced burger. The second time at this place, I tried the Euro Burger and Hell Kitchen's burger. Hell Kitchen definitely has a fusion-ey taste to it. It was really good as well. \\n\\nBUT IT IS THE PARMESAN FRIES THAT WERE SO SO SO GOOD. You have to try these fries. The oreo shake was really good as well if you have the stomach for extra sugar. The food overall is definitely something you should try if you like burgers. \\n\\nThe only downside is the long long wait. Last time I was there it was an hour and half wait so be prepared. Just don't go over when you are super hungry expecting to be seated right away because it won't happen. \\n\\nIn short,\\n4.5-5 stars for the food and 3.5 stars for the service and the long wait.\",\n",
       " \"I'm always at PH when I'm in Vegas and there's always a wait for BurGR, so this time, we decided to try it.\\n\\nI ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The Farm Burger was good. Not great, and definitely did not live up to the hype. It was made well and the duck breast is unique, but it was literally just duck, egg, cheddar, and bun. It was too plain in my opinion.\\n\\nThe truffle fries was yummy, but a little too thick in my opinion. I like my fries skinnier! Also, the ketchup and aioli are homemade and have unique tastes. My friends wanted to ask for normal Heinz ketchup but thought that would be embarrassing.\\n\\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"I really had high expectations coming in, and it really was a good experience.  I just think 120.00 for burgers and fries for a family of four is a lot.  If fries were included with the 16 to 19 dollar burgers it would definitely rate four or 4.5 stars.  The Parmesan fries were the family favorite and they went quickly.  We also got the jalapeño poppers for the table and they were spicy for the kids, but we're done pretty well.  If your gonna get a shake I recommend the toffee.  It was almost like eating the best part of a Carmel sundae.  The burgers were very good and cooked as they were ordered and the kids ate them up quickly, no complaints.\",\n",
       " \"Came to Vegas and this place was a MUST to eat at. \\n\\nFOOD: My fiancé and I shared the farm burger (Excellent and very juicy!), the truffle fries and the Maui onion rings! Everything we ordered tasted amazing and very flavorful. \\n\\nSERVICE: We arrived at opening hour so we knew it wasn't at full peak time yet. Let's of servers standing around, but I'm sure later during the lunch hour they were all needed. Overall, good service! A definite must try!\",\n",
       " \"Verdict: Overall, not bad. \\n\\nService is great, but food is so-so. Also, we had to wait 2 1/2 hours when they said it would only take an hour and 15 minutes. \\n\\nWould I come back? \\n\\nProbably not. The food is what's going to keep me coming back as a regular, not the service. I had the Farm burger and while it was good, it wasn't anything special. The bread was slightly dense, the meat was a little under-seasoned and the flavor that I was expecting from the fried egg and duck bacon, just wasn't anywhere to be found. \\n\\nAnd not to mention, after eating this burger, I was still hungry. \\n\\nAnd if you're still hungry after reading this review; do yourself a favor and grab a burger some place else. \\n\\nI'd bet 10 to 1 you'd love Bachi Burger over this spot any day.\",\n",
       " \"My friends loved their burgers. I was unimpressed by mine. The meat was dry and the flavor was far from being special. The fries were good, though, with many different dressings and ketchups. We didn't wait outside in line for long, but once we ordered, we waited too long for the food to arrive, that could definitely be improved. I'm only giving them 4 stars because that shake #4 has been the best one I've ever tried: crème brûlée pudding on top and Oreo shake in the bottom. First thing I'll grab when I go back to Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Have been here twice now and both times it was amazing. It is now going to be a tradition to go back on every trip we make to Vegas. There is always a wait but you can put your name in and they will send you a text when your table is almost ready so that you don't have to just stand in line. The first time I tried the burger the pepper on it and it was HOT I ended up having to pick it off halfway through but the flavor was incredible. The sweet potato fries are a must try, they are served with a dip that really makes the fries better than anyone else's. The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also, they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries. As far as service I would have expected something better from a place of Gordon's, that is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. We had to wait forever for refills and our waitress hardly checked back on us... at least the food didn't have any problems that needed addressing.\",\n",
       " \"Don't go if you're vegetarian/vegan. The meatless/portebello burger has good flavor but does not hold together. It's not put together well it greatly takes away from the experience.

We are talking 30+ minutes from order to delivery of food.  \\n\\nFood -  Fries are kept under a heat lamp while the burgers come out one at a time to the expediter.  Not good.  This means majority of the guests are waiting for others to receive their food before everyone gets to enjoy.  Sure goes against everything we've seen on Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef Mr. Ramsey.  Taste wise, have to admit it everyone enjoyed their burgers.\\n\\nWould I return?  I would, provided the overall experience in service improves.\",\n",

Burger was cooked to my order. The fries were dericious, when they were still hot. The 2 sauces (Truffle Aioli & Ketchup) that came with the fries made my taste buds go insane. I especially liked the in-house kitchen ketchup, it had a sweet flavoring to it. \\n\\nOverall: I would recommend this place for people visiting Vegas to at least try it out. \\nWill definitely come back and do another review after trying more of their menu!!',\n",

We all ordered the famous pig burger that was  topped with pulled pork, bacon, and coleslaw. \\n\\nThe burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the pulled pork was juicy and tender , the bacon was bacon, and the coleslaw brought it all together. \\n\\nSimply a great burger. It didn't come with fries but after taking a few bites your glad you got just the burger. The amazing thing was the buns held everything together and nothing fell out. \\n\\nI also ordered the chocolate pudding milk shake. Decadent , rich, filling, and so good. The milkshake is probably the second best thing here next to the burger. And it's a meal all on it's own. Rich chocolate flavor and topped with the most delicious pudding. \\n\\nIf you're in vegas , you have to come to Burgr.\",\n",
       " 'WHHHY OH WHY DID YOU DISAPPOINT GORDON. Husband and I were so eager to try this place out after reading such great reviews. Love the ambiance and hip feel to this place. Unfortunately there was nothing about the food that left us wanting to come back for more. Our waiter made our experience slightly awkward because not once did he shine a smile to us. He meant serious business from the get go. \\n\\nJalapeño poppers. I must warn you, it\\'s spicy as hell! Comes in a set of 6 with each popper pre-dunked in a cheese ranch sauce. I was expecting a crunchy outer shell with a soft and warm center with the cheese oozing out. No. Nothing close to it. The poppers already pre-dipped in individual sauces is a bad idea, Gordon. The sauce made them soggy and uneasy to eat. Would be much better if the sauce was on the side. \\n\\nBeer batter onion rings. Nothing amazing about it. Tastes like onion rings I eat at the state fair. Meh. \\n\\nFarm burger & American burger. Unfortunately both burgers are the upsets of our dining experience. I couldn\\'t even tell you how the burger tastes because the salt was so, SO overpowering at first bite. I even informed our waiter of our burgers being way to salty and there was nothing that could be done other than a careless \"Oh really?\" response. My husband and I both took one bite of the burger and left. (refer to my photo) No replacements was even offered to us. \\n\\nAll in all, this was by far the worse burger and meal I\\'ve had. Definitely will not be dining here again or at any other GR restaurants. What a disappointment.',\n",

       " \"After watching Gordon Ramsay on his shows, I had to come and try out this place myself. There was a line and we waited about under an hour. There's a huge menu outside; so it's good to get a glimpse of what they have to offer so you don't have to wait and waste time once you've got a table.\\n\\nFISH AND CRISP SANDWICH- ale battered cod, salt and vinegar crisps, and fresh dill tartar sauce\\nWhen I first saw it, it looked so good, but when I bit into it, it was bland and could've used more seasoning. The tartar sauce didn't do it much either. The cod tasted fresh, but lacked flavor. It had a nice crunch and consistency, but that was about it.\\n\\nHELL'S KITCHEN BURGER- asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato\\nI liked this burger. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. It tasted like a typical burger, but a burger done right. There were no bold flavors that stood out, but if you're craving for a burger then I would recommend this one because you got the melted cheese, the heat from the peppers, the creaminess from the avocado and the acidic juicy tomato all with the perfectly cooked patty.\\n\\nCHANTERELLE BURGER- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam\\nThis burger was earthy. The mushrooms and the arugula were very pre-dominant in this burger. I didn't enjoy it too much. It was okay, but a bit strong for my taste. The burger itself was not dry, but could've used more seasoning or another flavor profile.\\n\\nSWEET POTATO FRIES- vanilla powdered sugar, honey, and jalapeno mayo\\nIf you love sweet potatoes then these fries are for you! These fries had a nice outer crisp and sweetness to it because of the powdered sugar. The jalapeno mayo didn't add much heat to the fries, but there are different layers of sweetness.\\n\\nBEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS- parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, and cheddar ranch dip\\nI did not like the onion rings at all. They were so dry and almost flavorless. It says they use beer batter, but I didn't taste anything. What a huge disappointment! The serving was huge, but after one bite, it was left the way it was.\\n\\nTRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli\\nYou could really taste the truffles in these fries. They had such a strong taste and I love it! You could smell it and definitely taste it. Truffle has such a crisp taste, but if you only put a little in it's very subtle; so they must have put a butt load because it was so strong.\\n\\nOverall, the burgers here were okay. I was expecting more flavors because of the price, but then again it is Vegas; so expect mediocre food for inflated prices.\",\n",
       " 'We went on a Monday night around 8pm and the line was long. It wouldnt have been so bad if the heat from the sign wasnt making us both sweat like pigs.  Thank God we werent seated by that fire window of hell! Anywho, clearly we both ordered milk shakes which were amazing until we got to the bottom and the pudding that was formerly on the top was all that was left. It was a thick almost flavorless gunk that was less than appetizing which we could have easily done without. Having worked in restaurants it was disappointing to wait in line for almost 45 minutes to get inside and see that most of the staff had no sense of urgency. Tables that were empty sat uncleaned for much longer than I would expect and the appetizer didnt come out until after we were finished with our shakes. The wings were awesome and both burgers were delish (Farm & Hells Kitchen) but being 8 months preggo I ordered medium well and it was at best medium rare but I made it this far so I figured whats a little blood! Lol The fries and onion rings were average but the sauces were wonderful compliments. \\nLong story short great food, polite knowledgeable server but slooow service and such horrible outfits on such pretty girls. We will return for the food expecting a wait, undercooked burgers (which normally I like) and milk shakes hopefully without the icky pudding!',\n",

       " \"Went on a Monday night at around 9:30 PM. Because I went solo, I was seated promptly at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  I was pretty excited to sit there because I like the TV show Hell's Kitchen, but without all the drama and screaming, watching the kitchen work was fairly tame.  Parties of 2 apparently wait along the flame sign and can end up waiting for a while.  I ordered the Farm Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  It took a little bit of time, 20-30 minutes, to get food but I guess other people would order appetizers that would come out sooner.  The service was pretty attentive, refilling drinks and helpful.\\n\\nFarm Burger - Well-seasoned meat. It came with a fried egg done over-easy so that when the yolk is bitten into or squished too hard, as it was in my case, then the rest of the yolk oozes out over the rest of the burger.  The duck bacon was really tasty as well.  The bun is toasted but I don't think the bun in of itself was anything noteworthy.  Overall, a pretty good burger, but it's sort of pricey.\\n\\nTruffle Parmesan Fries - A little salty.  It comes with a truffle aioli dipping sauce that was pretty garlicky but fairly heavy as well as a homemade ketchup sauce that was also pretty good.  The ketchup can be overpowering and can cover up the taste of the parmesan and the fries themselves.  The fries themselves are the thick cut kind and pretty good by themselves but they can be over-salted.\\n\\nOverall, I would come back for the burgers even if they seem a bit pricey.\",\n",

There was a shift change while we were there waiting for our food, and the second bartenders were less helpful and friendly, but still prompt enough. \\n\\nThe food itself was no better than any other truck stop burger place. The meat patty was thick, but I couldn\\'t tell whether or not the quality of meat was any better than my local $4 diner joint or not, as it had no flavor, and lacked juice. The bun was dry, almost stale, and the(lack of) fixings on the burger were terrible. I ordered the blue cheese burger. It comes with a small wilted sprinkling of greens on top of the melted blue cheese, which by the way, completely overpowers the flavor of the burger. Nothing else. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love blue cheese, but I should be able to taste the meat. And, for $15 for an ala carte burger, I would have expected far superior quality than a stale bun, confusing flavor and texture. For the price and boastfulness of Gordon Ramsay, they should have added some chartreuse pickles, a tomato slice, a house made stone ground mustard (or any sauce for that matter), or some fries. \\nWe did order the \"just fries\", and they were not well prepared. Inside the fry funnel were some oversized, undercooked (terrible inconsistent texture) fries; some squishy with oil, and some burnt. If adding a little cumin to the fries is supposed to make them fancy enough to cost $8, I would re-think the quality at which they were coming from the kitchen. What an embarrassment.  If I were a world renowned chef, I wouldn\\'t put my name on products as poor as this. \\n\\nThe staff outfits were another train wreck. The body tight (and motion restrictive) miniskirt dresses on the hosts and servers were not at all attractive, and even though we were in Vegas where the objectivity of women is for some reason socially acceptable, it was to say the least, not helping the atmosphere of the restaurant. The outfits (required matching sneakers, jeans, and awful poly blend fabrics), looked like something straight out of the late 90s, tricking me into thinking I was on the set of Friends.\\n\\nThe end result, several hours later, I was gifted the unfortunate surprise of severe stomach cramps and a case of the trots, and two days later I am still suffering.

If you aren't in the mood for a burger, you can also have a hot dog. Accompanying your entree can also be sides of parmesan truffle fries, onion rings, and other delicious fried finger foods.

It had been grilled (heated) at some point but not recent to arriving to me.  The beef was tasty and well cooked.  There were 4 pickles and 2 tomato chunks teetering on top of the burger which made it difficult to close but even more difficult to get a bite of burger with pickle and tomato on it.

Okay on to the food, my friend got the creme brulee shake, it was really creamy/tasty but soooo rich! We shared the Parmesan onion rings, they were awesome! They were crispy and light, and had a generous amount of Parmesan on top. I also loved the cheddar ranch that came with it. We both ordered the farm burger which had English cheddar cheese, fried egg, and duck breast bacon on it. It was a pretty good burger, good enough for 14$? I don't know... Overall I had a good experience and would come back to try another burger and get those onion rings again.\",\n",
       " \"The Worst SLOWEST service everrrrrr!!! A total joke. Couldn't tell u much about the food because after coming in hungry & waiting OVER an HOUR for any food to come out we would've eaten anything!! \\nOh & aren't the apps supposed to come out first ? They were about 20 minutes after our burgers. \\nStaying here but never again. Could've walked 20 minutes away & eaten sooner than we were served here. Blah! \\n* I took pix of food but won't even post them because after such a horrendous experience I can't recommend coming here.\",\n",
       " \"I see lots of great reviews. Either this place has gone down hill or people don't have high expectations. \\n\\nAfter eating here, I would infer if Gordon were to make a surprise visit, he'd be yelling profanity. \\nThe server was unfriendly and barely came to check on us. \\n\\nBottom line: $55 for 2 burgers, fries, onion rings, and 1 soda. \\n\\nOnion rings- fantastic!  Earns a star. \\n\\nBurgers- the highlight of the burger is the bun, because that's what you'll taste when you bite into the sandwich.  A dry, large bun will overtake the burger patty end whatever else is on it. \\n\\nTruffle fries- not good.  \\n\\n\\nFor a world famous chef with his name on the restaurant, this was a bummer and we will never be back. \\n\\nWant a fantastic burger?  Take an Uber to Carson Kitchen downtown.  It's worth getting away from the strip to try.\",\n",

I ordered the American, it was good but the hubby ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, and it was soooo good. I recommend that one along with the truffle fries.

Once again the food was amazing and even got a nice surprise from one of the managers, so thanks Darren or Benji or whoever the secret surpriser was. One thing that is really nice is the managers come by and say hi, ask how everything is, or in my case its \"your back again already?\" haha\\n\\n btw - all of the hostesses, waitstaff, bussers, chefs are awesome, informative,friendly and fun, I will totally be back, (I\\'m going to be the first person to complete the entire menu) and I will be telling every one to try the place out too.\\n\\nWaitress Ginger was awesome and a cutie and the little hostess (i cant remember her name right now, but she has a  tattoo on her left upper arm (looks like a lotus flower) she is a perfect start to the eating experience, (great smile) \\n\\nAnd finally, not to be mean or make any one that wrote a review mad, I\\'m sorry if you had a bad experience, I would suggest trying it a second time, maybe even tell one of the managers that your first time wasn\\'t the greatest, they will make sure it doesn\\'t happen a 2nd time and for anyone complaining about the prices, its Vegas, everything is let\\'s say Vegas priced, most things cost more, some things cost less than at home, helpful hint, join Total Rewards, the prices on the right of the menu are the discounted rate if your a TR member, show them your card each time you eat.

Out waiter was attentive. \\n\\nCons: I had ordered the American burger and my friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both had NO flavor. We both ordered our burgers medium but they came out medium rare, my bottom bun was soggy with blood by the time it got to me. We also ordered the truffle fries, which we couldn't even really taste the truffle oil, and they were soggy. \\n\\nWE WERE BOTH EXTREMELY SICK AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT. I will not go into detail, but we are still suffering even the next day. \\n\\nOverall: we spent $74 on 2 drinks, 2 burgers, 1 appetizer, and fries.

That last part is relevant because if you live in an area with a high concentration of good burger options, chances are you won\\'t be overly impressed with Ramsay\\'s Burgr. That isn\\'t to say this is bad, or even mediocre, but it isn\\'t providing something I haven\\'t had already. \\n\\nFor one thing, the lengthy line out front is barely justified. I had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a seat for a burger. I know it\\'s all because of whose burger it is, still sucked. \\n\\nI started off with the truffle fries, which come with a garlic aioli and a fancy house ketchup. They were delicious, especially with the aioli. I wasn\\'t too hot on the ketchup. To me, ketchup is one of those condiments that shouldn\\'t be messed with too much. I don\\'t use it often, but when I do I expect the flavor to be consistent. \\n\\nThe blue burger seemed to be their standard offering, so I went with that. It\\'s very simple, which allows for the meat to do most of the talking. It told me that it\\'s tender and succulent and juicy, so I devoured it. The toppings only consisted of a little arugula and some blue cheese. The bun was excellent, some kind of seed-y, doughy bread. Could\\'ve done with a bit of a toasting on the inside, but that\\'s only a minor complaint. \\n\\nPricing was in line with what you\\'d expect at a \"luxury\" burger spot.  It\\'s certainly worth stopping in if you\\'re in town, but maybe not for repeat visits. Not with that line, at least.',\n",

The outside was inviting...gassed fiery  flames lined the glass wall for guests to admire while waiting to get inside. Being a fan of Gordon I was thrilled, getting my picture taken outside of the restaurant, checking out the interactive menu searching for the perfect burger. It was my first time in Vegas and I thought BURGR would be the highlight. I would finally be able to taste the food that I had been lacking all my life. 45min-1hr wait in line later while watching his hostesses clad in unimpressive tight red polyester 60s looking roller skating dresses with skateboard running shoes without socks and lacy cup of bra peeping out walk up and down the lineup asking people their names and telling everyone front of line to back that the wait would be only 15 min, a lie. I am 32, mother is 52 I have eaten many a restaurant meal and consider myself a foodie. We were sat and handed a cardboard menu. 15 min later we were met by a female in darker clothing and again skateboard runners without socks. We ordered our drinks a Pepsi and diet Pepsi. Looking at the menu I was unimpressed that everything was a la carte, u mean you order a hamburger for  $15 and you do not get fries? In all of his tv shows u always get fries after all what is a burger without fries.\\n\\nI looked around and realized most of the people settled on splitting one fry for the both of them after all the fry cost another 11-14 dollars!!! For fries!!!!\\n\\nBy this point I was thinking this was going to be the best burger of my life!!!!! \\n\\n20-30mins later no drinks we were parched it was 118degrees outside in Vegas and we hadn't even received water let alone our drinks.\\n\\nThe hostess did a double take, we had not received our drinks!!! She apologized and asked if we had ordered them yet as if that was a question, we said yes about 5minutes later a bus boy brought them to us.\\n\\n 10-minutes later the hostess came by and apologized and made up the excuse of not getting our drinks as the waitress we had was pregnant and had to eat between serving meals really? well I thought at least someone was eating, not their guests though. \\n\\nFinally our waitress appeared  to take our order seemingly unfazed and unaware that our drink order had been issued by a bus boy.I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger, my mother the classic burger, we split the truffle Parmesan  fries. My mother ordered her burger well done...she said she did not like any pink in hers..I ordered mine and I quote..well.well.well.well.well.done.I like my burger hot, no pink...the waitress said she will write it down for cooks. In hindsight we were making excuses upon excuses for the restaurant service...but at that point we were just excited to receive our meals...our stomachs hungry from the wait......and wait.....and wait..another hour later we were finally served...again by the poor bus boy...who tried to smooth it over with a smile....at this point I was relieved we were even served...actually by this point the excitement was gone...but we made more excuses for the restaurant....because it was going to be delicious right?\\n\\nWe first took pictures with our burgers...I honestly felt bad..the poor pathetic burger all alone on its plate...just sitting there...unimpressive really....my poor mother was excited...see she had lettuce and tomato on hers so it appeared bigger...but I knew better.....poor mom. The 14 dollar fries came in a cone. \\n\\nAfter the pictures we each cut our burger in half. I saw pink in mine...gulp...but seeing I wanted my mother to have a good experience I swallowed my disappointment...up until she said....oh my god..my burger is bleeding on my plate....my heart sunk....noooooo...I knew my mother would not eat hers. I guess our faces gave it away because the hostess came over and asked if we liked our burgers...my mom said she could not eat hers..it was rare...I didn't say anything about mine..I felt bad for my mom...but mine was also pink...hostess got manager...manager came over and asked..if we like our burgers? My mother said hers was bleeding onto the plate..manager picked up plate..my mom didn't wanna wait another hr for burger..I didn't wanna eat alone...what about the fries? They would be cold...I was mad...I told the manager we expected more from a restaurant especially from Ramsey's restaurant...I pointed to sign...BURGR. She said she would fix the burger and walked away. I ate my burger...it was bland..not hot or spicy ..the bun was soggy..the burger soft..no taste..I think I ate one hint of jalapeño on whole thing..our fries were gross...melted with Parmesan and salted to the point that my mouth was feeling raw...the manager returned with my moms burger and new fries...she ate in silence...I was already done my meal...I felt bad....even worse when the waitress returned with our bill which totalled $49 for 2 burgers and one fry-total wait time approx. 3h u decide\",\n",

A friend just raved about how amazing it was and how we must go. Checked out Google timeline and found an okay time with less of a crowd. Pretty short wait, even though they were busy. \\n\\nWhen we were say, we noticed the table and chair heights are kind of wonky,  but we liked it. The menu presentation was unique and the waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. As i don't live in Vegas, I decided to try the most popular item which was a burger with jalapeno on it. Amazing. I devoured that burger. \\n\\nThe milkshakes are amazing too. Save room for it. It's well worth it.\\n\\nHow this place lost two stars: I was kicked out of Penn  & Teller for puking outside the theater. I was up all night sick, had to fly home severely dehydrated, and was this close to asking for someone to take my uninsured bum to the ER. 9 days later, I finally was able to eat normal food again.

       " \"If you've ever watched Kitchen Nightmares, Chef Ramsay always makes it a point for a restaurant to have a very good burger on its menu. The cleverly named Gordon Ramsay BurGR has several to choose from, all ranging from $14-18. \\n\\nMy penchant for something hot led me to the Hell's Kitchen burger. I liked that instead of the usual pepper jack cheese, this burger had asadero with roasted jalapeño peppers instead. The burger itself was well-cooked and I enjoyed the nicely toasted sesame-topped bun. However, this burger with Mexican-inspired ingredients lacked the bold spicy flavor I was craving. On the other hand, my companions tried the farm burger, which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I can never complain about a burger topped with an egg. I thought the farm burger had more flavor and came together nicer than the Hell's Kitchen burger. \\n\\nFor sides, we ordered truffle parmesan fries and beer-battered Maui onion rings. Truffle fries have been overdone for a while now, but I couldn't resist a good aioli dip. I wasn't a fan of the onion rings as I found them to be over-battered. \\n\\nIf you're coming to BurGR, forget the burgers, fries, or cocktails. The one thing you should try are the shakes. Generically numbered 1 through 5, they are really something special. Each shake is methodically layered with the shake, a pudding, and topped with a cookie. We tried shake #5, which was a coffee shake with a chocolate hazelnut pudding (reminiscent of Nutella), topped with a praline cookie. It was like three desserts in one. A fantastic treat that had us wanting more throughout the whole meal. \\n\\nThe service was great and the line moved pretty quickly as the table turnaround was quick. There are plenty of other burger joints to frequent around The Strip and if I found myself around PH, I would probably opt for the cheaper Earl of Sandwiches, but  the shakes here are hard to pass up.\",\n",

The burgers I tried were actually quite good especially the portobello one (Earth Burger). The mushrooms were so juicy and flavorful that it almost rivals a slice of real beef patty.  Buns were nicely toasted with good spongy texture. Rest of the toppings were fresh.

Is that an oxymoron? Maybe, but it's true! They were sprinkled with powdered sugar..... Would have gone great with our sticky toffee pops. \\nWhich brings me to my next point. With all the hype on these pops I fully expected them to blow me away and they just didn't. They had been in a really cold fridge or freezer and tasted good but just not super. \\nWould I come back? Heck yes! Go shopping and have them call me when my table is ready! One mojito please!\",\n",
       " '\"2 scollops! 3 beef welligtons! How long?!!\"\\nHahaha I love watching Gordon Ramsay get mad. When I saw this place, I knew I have to try it - see what GR is all about.  \\nHis fame is pretty legit by the looks of the line for BurGR - we waited a good 1+hour in line. Then waited 30mins for our burgers to come. \\n- chanterelle burGR: yum! Figgy onion, mushroom, beef patty, arugula\\n- truffle fries: the truffle is in the dipping sauce, not sprinkled over the fries like Umami burger style\\n- onion rings: this is a must try. So good. The sauce too! So good. \\nOverall... It was worth it. I would wait this long again the second time though. I feel like the staff is not quick enough with cleaning up the dirty tables, hence the humongous line outside.',\n",
       " \"First off it took an over an hour for our food to get there, making Ramsay a total hypocrite. He would have verbally assaulted himself if it were on one of his TV shows. The service was good, pretty simple menu. Which is the thing that bothers me if your going to have a simple menu it better be great food, and it just wasn't. Sweet pickles on a burger does not make it any classier. I don't care who you are or how classy you think you are, ketchup belongs on the table at a burger restaurant. Overall this place has all the bells and whistles looks great, but the food is average at best, and the restaurant itself is unorganized. Gordan Ramsay sold out and put his name on a below average restaurant.\",\n",

My husband had the Farm burger and I had the Britannia, both were quite good and cooked to our requested temperature. Also got an order of the truffle fries, which were great on their own , but the curry ketchup really made them sing. \\n\\nThe biggest downside was the service; we were spared from being overly exposed to our server\\'s Ben Stine-like personality by the simple fact that she was never at out table. We saw her a total of three times: to take our order, drop off the check, and to sign for the check (a different server brought our food).

Very, very good. \\n\\nAftermath: within the time it took us to walk back to our hotel, 15 minutes. My wife and I were both in the same boat. We had very bad, and very instant, diarrhea!

We were staying at Planet Hollywood, so after sending my hubby out to win us some money, I decided to get a Burgr burger to go. It is still a 25 minute wait when you get it to go.

       " 'Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I \"train\" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.\\n\\nAnyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay\\'s BurGR wasn\\'t even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn\\'t pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. \\n\\nSo after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself isn\\'t anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. \\n\\nThe menu isn\\'t so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn\\'t deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn\\'t so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.\\n\\nWe also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein\\'s shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn\\'t keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. \\n\\nOur food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn\\'t impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn\\'t memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. \\n\\nOverall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein\\'s.  Dang those shakes really got me.',\n",

       " \"This review is after my second visit to this restaurant. My first time was two years ago, and I was blown away. They service was good, the food was good, seemed like good quality. I eat organic, so it is difficult for me to find good quality food that i don't get sick from. Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, we thought maybe it would be sourced well. Again, my first visit, I really enjoyed.\\n\\nThis time around, I had a bit different experience. I am giving a 3 star due to the service. That was good. Probably waited 20-25 minutes for a table, but that wasn't so bad. The hostess was nice and sat us at a nice table away from others. Friendly, helpful waitress who was happy to bring us anything we needed. Ordered the onion rings, which did taste really good, although our plates were not the cleanest. Not sure if the guy that dropped them off spilled soda that he was taking to another table on them while he was carrying them, or if they came that way from the kitchen, but not really Gordon quality! They are on point with the flavors on their dipping sauces. I'll give them that much. Got the farm burger for dinner and my BF got the 3 cheese burger. Was cooked the way we asked, but the meat was still a bit dry, and just didn't have the same quality as last time (I'm talking, melt in your mouth burger, the first time.). I ate as much as i could, paid our bill and left.\\n\\nI always judge food quality by how i feel after, as my body is pretty sensitive to foods that are not organic. I felt full for 3 days after this. That's not really a normal thing. I guess I can't really complain because I knew it wasn't organic, but I can tell you that the food has gone down in quality. For what they charge, that is too bad. I will not be eating at BurGR again. :-(\",\n",

My wife couldn't sleep that night and she felt sick and she ended up in the bathroom throwing up basically every she ate.For me , The next two days of that night were a nightmare.

We also ordered the beer battered onion rings. OMG! They were some of the best onion rings I ever had. They came with a ranch dipping sauce that was so good I wanted to take some home with me! \\n\\nThis was a really tough one for me. Between Guy Fieri and Gordon Ramsay they both had different things that I really enjoyed. I liked my burger at Guy Fieri better and the fact that it came with a variety of fries for no extra charge.

When the Gooey fries came out, it was more that we expected but they were delicious and it was hard to stop eating them even when we were full. The staff was friendly and attentive, the manager even stopped by our table for a second to check on our meal and experiance. Very friendly guy and nice vibe.

It ruined her apatite thinking that the ravioli was probably someone\\'s lunch. The chef told us it would be impossible considering that the cooks are not allowed to eat \"on the line\". Right on... But where did he pasta come from? What if the pasta was a nut, but in my burger. Two \"what ifs\", but if something not on the menu made it into a burger then why not?\\n\\nThey comped the burger which was fine, but my girlfriend leaving unsatisfied made our overall experience not worth it.',\n",

It was good until I got to the end when it got too salty and oily. Their beer selection wasn't good. \\n\\nOverall it was good but not great. The place is a bit pricey for burgers. Burger is huge so you can split one, and when you do they cut it in half for you so it is easier to share. I wouldn't go back.

       " \"The wife and I went today for lunch.  Arrived with a very short wait for a table.\\n\\nService - The service was good, and really would have been great if our waitress wasn't as long winded.  She was incredibly friendly, but maybe she was trying a bit too hard.  It wasn't a big deal in the end, and she was really energetic and informative, so this is most likely an empty complaint.  Our water was kept full and our needs were a top priority the whole time.\\n\\nAmbiance - It was decent.  It is on the casino floor, if in a relatively quiet area if that could be said of a casino floor.  The was no detectable tobacco aroma.  The uniforms were fine.  Amazingly it was my wife that noticed the girls skirts are incredibly short.  Our waitress was very tall and after observing this at head level while seated, I really am surprised that I didn't notice this immediately.  The decor was an ingesting choice. The tables are very nice, if small.  There is a TV above practically every table.  It has as almost sports bar like feel . . . actually, I take that back, there is no almost about it.\\n\\nDrinks - Milady is knocked up, so no booze there.  I was thinking beer with a burger.  They do offer a selection of cocktails on the iPad drink menu.  With 2 people this seems practical, though with more it would be annoying(see my GR Pub & Grill review).  The beer selection is strong, with many options varying between macro lager, imports, American craft options and a cider or two.  $7 Oaked Arrogant Bastard pints?!?  Yeah, I am just fine with that.\\n\\nFood - Again, with milady's condition, no undercooked meats.  She did brave the eggs of Ceaser salad and was happy for it.  I shockingly elected to go for a burger.  I went with the Blue Burger, which is a simple preparation of burger, Stilton and arugula.  I also ordered a side of Just Fries, which as the name implies are plain fries.  My burger arrived in about 15 minutes.  I ordered medium-rare and received medium to med-well.  It was a flavorful burger, and the pungent blue, peppery arugula and smokey beef were well balanced and complimentary.  They use a blend of short rib, chuck and brisket, which had me expecting an immensely juicy, fatty burger.  Alas, I won't call it dry, but juicy it wasn't.  The bun was amazing though and easily the best part of the burger.  As to the fries, they were crispy and hot.  I don't really know what more you would look for out of basic fries.  They come with both a chipotle and chutney inspired ketchup.  I leaned more to the chutney, the chipotle was boring.  \\n\\nOverall - A decent meal, but lackluster considering $50 for 1 burger, 1 beer, a salad and some fries.  Liked it, but won't be back.\",\n",

It is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel right outside of there casino. The restaurant itself is pretty nice although my dad and I didn't sit in the restaurant we ate at the bar. I felt that the service was nice for us because we didn't go to the restaurant at dinner time. We went around 2 and it wasn't crowded! The food took a little while to get to us and everything is a la cart so be prepared to pay for everything and nothing is under 10$. There also isn't free refills so when my dad got the bill he was shocked at the price. We got 2 burgers which where basically 15$ each and regular fries which where 8$ and then unfortunately we got 3 refills of our drink which where not free. So our bill was 65$! The drinks where small too so that's why we got so many. I would recommend getting water! Also my dad got the American burger which looked really good and he confirmed that it was really good as well. The French fries where good and we got there ketchup which was a chipotle ketchup and the ranch which was good but not as flavorful as you would expect for Gordon Ramsey. So in conclusion I would say if you are a big Ramsey fan and you like burgers go because it's good but you might be surprised by the price at the end but then again everything in Vegas is expensive weather they say so or not.\",\n",

When he returns, he ignores what was put into the iPad and just asks what we want to drink and writes it down...\\n\\nHe made some recommendations for the burGRs and we placed our order.\\n\\n.....Bueller?  Bueller?  I mean... Waiter?  Waiter?  Where is the food?\\nUnfortunately the wait for our two burGRs was over a half hour.  They must be butchering my cow to order out there... geesh.\\n\\nThe food however, was delicious and cooked to perfection.  This place would EASILY earn 5 stars from me if the service was just a tad bit better.  Servers need to be a bit more attentive, I noticed the same aggravation at the tables around me.\\n\\nAs much as I enjoyed my burGR - I don't know that I'd choose to make a 1.5hr ordeal for it.\",\n",

I've probably eaten hundreds of burgers over my lifetime and am on the perpetual quest for the BEST burger. With that said... \\n\\nI was expecting so much more from Mr. Ramsay (especially after waiting for an hour- thank goodness for YOLO! down the way in PH). I normally don't have expectations (this way you're never disappointed!)... but after seeing him on TV... I expected this to be an AMAZING burger. It was good... but not GREAT. The hubby and I split the Farm burger and fries. Fries were yummy... loved the sauce... but all in all... wasn't my favorite burger of all time. \\n\\nOverall- Gave it an 8.\",\n",
       " \"While we were fortunate to get a table within 5 minutes, and our waitress was very friendly, what a disappointment this visit turned out to be. \\n\\n$16 for a tough overcooked burger (that tasted like it started out frozen) isn't something I yearn for. And while the fig-oniony sauce sounded fab, there was so little of it on the burger that only one bite showcased the flavor so what's the point? Lastly on the burger, the bun was hard and stale, seems to me a burger joint should be able to do better than this. \\n\\nBest part of the meal was the onion rings, with nice and crispy batter and the cheesy ranch was an interesting dip. \\n\\nWe finished off lunch with the sticky toffee pops and those were icky. The ice cream was crystally like it'd been frozen a very long time, and the cake portion was cloyingly sweet.\\n\\nAfter today's meal, the conclusion is I won't need to return.\",\n",

We were told that the wait was 3 hours... I could feel my heart sinking. I've always wanted to dine at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and this was probably the most reasonably priced one in Las Vegas. Anyway, we decided to mull over if would be able to wait three hours for a table at the slots. We waited about an hour before we received a text saying our table would be ready soon. YAAAAAAY, ran back over to the restaurant. So here's a first tip: don't let the hostess scare you with her time estimates! \\n\\nSat down, our server was immediately impressive and knowledgeable about everything we wanted to know about the menu. He gave us great recommendations on both beer and the food. I decided to go with the farm burgers, coz I mean duck bacon. 'Nuff said. But I did try all my tables burgers as well which were the Hog and the Blue Cheese burger. Mine was still my favorite! We also had a side of the truffle fries which were out of this freakin' world. \\n\\nAnyway I definitely want to come back soon, the experience was overall just too good not to go back. \\n\\nRecommendations: The Farm Burger and truffle fries with the vanilla-y beer (I forget the name but just ask for Gordon's personal favorite beer)\",\n",

My burger was cooked perfectly but less than half way through eating I was craving another element, a sauce perhaps or more combination of texture. My fries were fresh, warm and crisp but it was so crisp (overcooked) that all I taste was a lot of hard crunch with no potato. \\n\\nMy fiance ordered the Hell's Burger. Delicious but also missing moisture and flavor from a sauce. I understand gourmet meat is seasoned simply to compliment the proteins' natural flavor,  but put me over the top, don't just serve good burgers, make them great. \\n\\nWait time and service was not bad at all, compliments to the line and cooks, uniforms were quite $ not $$, overall go try for yourself.\",\n",

The patty were so juicy since we all ordered medium well, but we did get different burgers. All I remember was ordering the hells kitchen burger. Damn so juicy and so delicious. My boyfriend ordered the new burger thats not on the menu, cousin ordered the american burger, and her significant other ordered the farm burger. All was amazing. There french fries were the best I've ever tasted. We had regular fries, sweet potato fries, and the fries that come with the parmesan. Omg so worth coming here.\",\n",

There was a long line but for some reason, my party of 7 were seated in about 5 minutes. Our server, Mike went above and beyond to make sure everything went well and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us great suggestions.

The burger was noticeably smaller.  Prior to today, I wouldn\\'t be able to take a full bite from my husbands farm burger but now I can no problem and it isn\\'t tasty. My \"über\" cheese burger lacked cheese, ironically. My husbands cocktail felt rushed and basic, unlike before, where it was complex and delicious. We sent our wings and poppers back because the wings were clearly burnt and the poppers were over cooked and tasteless. The waiter took only the wings off of our bill. It just didn\\'t have the same touch. Farewell burgr, I won\\'t be spending another dime dining at this now mediocre restaurant.',\n",

Ramsey knows how to put everything together for a fun, delicious meal experience!\",\n",
       " \"This is not a burger. This is a burger experience. Of course the quality of each ingredient of the burger is at it's highest. Of course the meat is cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. All of these things considered, and this burger still blows me away. When you take a bite of most burgers you taste each ingredient, and that's cool. With this burger you sink your teeth in, and you close your eyes and you are floating. You are floating in a sea of burger flavor, and you stare into the burger sky, and tears come to your face as you realize you have never been in this paradise before. Tears run down your face as you realize you are out of this world as soon as you swallow. Each bite is a swirl of flavors each ingredient mixing and mingling together in your mouth complementing and teasing each other. Each bite is a million kisses from the boy or girl that has broken your heart. Each bite is an orchestra hitting the hardest and best note of the entire performance. Each bite is bliss. Each bite is love. This was a true experience, and I could go on and on, but like this burger all great things in life must come to an end.\",\n",

I watch a lot of chef Ramsey's cooking shows and I was excited to finally try out one of his restaurants. It 100% lived up to my exprectations . I went on a Thursday night and we were seated immediately . The burger was 14 dollars but it is well worth it . The decor of the restaurant is also very cute and modern . If you are in Vegas and need a bougie burger and fries this is a must try !!!\",\n",
       " \"The burgers are delicious here.  I always wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  There's always a line during dinner.  We waited maybe about 30-40 min for a table for two.  They probably could have sat people down sooner, since we saw quite a few open spots as we were being seated.  Larger groups had longer waits of course.  The Hell's Kitchen Burger was absolutely superb.  I actually enjoyed this burger better than any of the burgers I've had at Holstein's inside the Cosmopolitan.  The burger was so juicy and so flavorful, I absolutely loved it.  The Fury Chicken Wings were great too.  I loved how each had a little handle, made for easier devouring.  I loved the size and flavor of them, absolutely tasty and very spicy. Got the fries as well, this definitely was my least favorite.  Thick cut just isn't my thing for fries.  Our waiter was nice and checked in on us frequently.  Would definitely come back again.  Craving for the burger and wings again!\",\n",
       " \"After our hour long wait, I must've been cranky or something because I was really disappointed with the overall experience here. I was debating between 2 or 3 stars and after much debate, I finally landed on 2 stars...here's why.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cool and I love the open kitchen concept. Having a little iPad to play with and peruse the menu is also very cool but the darn thing ended up being more of a pain than useful. It was difficult to get from section to section and the novelty quickly wore off.  \\n\\nAside from our long wait, the visit actually started off great. We had a friendly, super sweet and upbeat waitress who was fantastic. We ordered the jalepeno poppers as an appetizer to the share amongst the 4 of us dining here.  They leave the seeds in one of the six poppers in to make it fun for those dining and sadly, I didn't get it - I love spicy. The poppers were nice and crispy on the outside and inside was stuffed with creamy cheese.  The dipping sauce it was served it was fantastic!  I wish I could get the recipe to that baby because it was one of the highlights of the meal. \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the farm burger which came with duck breast bacon, a fried egg, and sharp cheddar cheese. And for the table we ordered the famous truffle fries. As expected, I loved the truffle fries and the dipping sauces that came with were very tasty. The problem that I had was with the burger. I had asked for it to be medium but when I got it, my fried egg was way overcooked.  The waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen remake it but when I got my burger back, the egg was still more done than I would've liked as well as the burger patty itself. Remember, I ordered it medium and it ended up being more well done. \\n\\nGordon Ramsay is an internationally renowned chef who has trained alongside greats such as Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon and he opens a burger joint??  Some of his restaurants have received 3 michelen stars but yet....here, his staff could not get a fried egg, nor a burger done right?  This makes me believe that this restaurant is purely a money maker for him because I felt ripped off and was disappointed that I bought into the hype.  Clearly, I wasn't impressed.\",\n",

Since we had a party of 4 and there was a wait, we put our name on the list and received a text when our table was ready.  We were able to walk around for about 20 minutes and then headed back when we got our text.  The head trainer (?) I think that was what he called himself was our waiter and he was PHENOMENAL.  You could tell he was very passionate about his job, answered all our questions, gave great recommendations and served us excellently.  We ended up ordering the special hog burger, hell's kitchen burger, euro and earth burgers.  The hell's kitchen was freakin amazing and the hog burger was delish.   I didn't get to taste the euro and earth burgers, but was told they were good.  We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries and OMG... they were spectacular.  Very tasty!  We also ordered shake #5 (coffee shake, hazelnut pudding, praline cookie) and it tasted as amazing as it looked!  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in vegas.  Food and service was top-notch!\",\n",

The truffled fries were good, but their fresh-cut fries and kicked-up ketchup makes me sure the plain fries are awesome too. Server was great. Boddington's on tap is great.

So, factor in the waiting time if you plan to go there. \\n - Time to get food served is about 30 mins. So, if you are really really hungry and can't wait for 30 mins for a premium burger, skip this place. \\n\\nThe Good: \\n-  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was the best burger I had. \\n- Honey-Pig Bao Buns from snacks are awesome! \\nWhat else can I say? If you are on the strip on Vegas and looking for a good burger, this is the place to visit.

I got the farm burger which was good but I ordered it medium and it barely had pink in it at all.  I hate it when my burgers are dry.  My boyfriend ordered the hell's kitchen burger and it had some spice to it, but there was just too much avocado.  The truffle parmesan fries were good, but not the best I've had.  I did enjoy the  handmade sauces that paired with the fries.  Overall the food was ok, but if this was an episode of Hell's Kitchen I'm sure Gordon Ramsay would be screaming at the cooks haha\\n\\nOn a good note, the servers/bartenders at the bar were nice and very personable to not only us but all the customers at the bar.  If you have a total rewards card you get a couple bucks off your meal.  If you want to try this place I would sit at the bar :)\",\n",

The saving grace is that the Hells Kitchen burger was great.  The fries were not bad either. The overall experience was not a a great one. Outside of the cool looking fire mural at the entrance the place is just another burger restaurant.  As an add on, both of us did not feel well even many hours after eating there.',\n",

With that said, the burger here was good.  There were JUST a few things that could have been changed to make it GREAT.\\n\\nI ordered the farm burger, and like the rest of my group, it was cooked just north of medium.  Also, the fried egg that was supposed to \"ooze\" as I bite into my burger did not ooze.  It really barely squished a bit.  THAT was most disappointing.  Despite the slightly over-cooked patty and the non-oozing fried egg, the burger was good.  If those two things had been on par, it probably would have been freakin delicious.  Along with the burgers, we also ordered the sweet potatoe fries and the garlic parmesan fries, and both were great, but ordinary.\\n\\nOur server was awesome.  She was nice and super knowledgable about the menu and happily answered each and every question we had with extreme detail.  \\n\\nOh yes, and the last thing I want to mention is that our food took a really long time to come out, at least 40 minutes.

For once, the condiments within the burger did not interfere with the taste of the meat. I can pick out the taste of the bun, meat, lettuce, onion and tomatoes with every bite. This is a top quality burger and definitely satisfied my burger cravings.\\n\\nTheir onion rings were a little above average. Very flavorful with a lot of seasoning.

       " 'BurGR is open late on Friday and Saturday nights. Unfortunately they do NOT allow reservations. So you have to wait if you want lunch or dinner at a traditional lunch/dinner time. I went there at around 12am at night, so there was pretty much no wait. We were seated almost immediately. Here\\'s what is so wonderful about this restaurant that made me give it a 5:\\n\\n1) Service -  The service here was SPOT ON. Our server was extremely friendly. He came by pretty much a couple of minutes after we got seated (I was too busy looking at the surroundings to be impatient too), and gave us an iPad to take a look at the drinks menu (pretty darn cool). He told us straight out that they were a little busy and that it might take him a little longer to get around to us. Just the fact that he told us that was a +1 in my book. Plus, he didn\\'t actually take that long to get to us. The time in between him popping in our table to get the drinks order and to get the food order was perfect in my mind. We didn\\'t feel rushed, and we didn\\'t feel like it was too slow. It was great that when he served the food, he even told us what was the ingredients in each dish. It was also AMAZING that he didn\\'t drop by too many times to ask how we were \"doing\" with the food. Another thing we noticed was that he never asked if we wanted more water, he just notices it and brings us a new cup of water (yes a new cup, not come by and refill the cup) without disrupting our conversation. Another +1 in my book.\\n\\nI saw a couple of reviews where people complained about the girls in the front gossiping and talking amongst themselves. I have to admit that that part is a bit true. The girls who are seating you stood in the front in a group of two to three sometimes, and they were just talking with each other. HOWEVER, what differed in my experience was that though they were talking to each other, once I walked by the front desk to ask them where the restrooms are (they are right across the restaurant by the way, I was so dumb), they immediately snapped their attention to me and did not continue talking to each other until they\\'ve answered my question. I didn\\'t feel like I needed to stand there and wait for them to finish talking or anything. They immediately noticed me and answered my dumb question.\\n\\n2) Food - For a burger place, the food was pretty darn amazing. We got the five spice chicken sliders for appetizers and that was, I think, the greatest part about my meal. The chicken was PERFECTLY juicy and friend/cooked SO crispily. The five spices that were in the sliders were not overwhelming nor was it underwhelming. The sliders were not too salty, and it had just the right amount of creamy flavor. I loved it!\\n\\nI got the Apple Cider drink that was recommended to us. It was made very well, and had very little hints of alcohol/beer in it. My partner and I are not a big fan of beer, yet we were able to stomach this very well because it tasted just like apple cider without the alcohol!\\n\\nThe truffle fries were amazing. It was not overly salty and it had a great balance of flavor. My taste buds are generally very sensitive to salt since I cook with very little salt and oil. Here, I did not feel that any of the food was overly salty at all.\\n\\nFor entrees we got the Hell\\'s Kitchen burger and the Char Siu Burger. I thought the Hell\\'s Kitchen burger was a bit better/unique than the Char Siu Burger. The Hell\\'s Kitchen burger was great with the japaleno kick, and it was not super spicy at all. The Char Siu burger was a bit sweet, which was what added the edge to this burger. Both were very well made, to our specifications (medium rare). The buns are made in house and it was the right amount of fluffy and crispness. Also, during this whole meal we did not feel heavy at all, which was really amazing because many burger joints are very heavy. We felt full, but not bursting with oily/salty heaviness after the meal.\\n\\n\\n- - - - -\\n\\nAll in all, we felt that this place was a great value (it\\'s not even THAT expensive) and the service was great, as was the food. I\\'d definitely visit again!',\n",
       " \"Wait: A group of us came at around 5pm and had a 20 minute wait. It wasn't bad at all because they call you when your table is ready so you can walk around while you wait.

I also had some of their banana milkshake with butterscotch pudding on top. That was amazing but it got too sweet to finish the last few bites. Last but not least, their fries!!! I tried the sweet potato fries with powdered sugar and truffle fries with aioli sauce. EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS. Come with a group of friends so you can try a little bit of everything.\\n\\nService: I deducted 1 star because the waitress was not very attentive and we waited a while until she came to give us the bill. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the ok service, I would give this place a 5 star.

The long wait is not fun. Lots waitress but it took 10 mins for waitress to show up say hi. Slow service. Well, food is really good and in a very good price, 12-16 a good burger is cheap in Vegas.

The hamburger had no flavor, grill or otherwise. The duck bacon did not bring the added flavoring as pork bacon would. The fries were standard... The spicy ketchup was good.

We ordered the Onion Rings as an app, let me tel you, they are by far the BEST onion rings I have ever had. Amazing!! For dinner we both ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and shared the truffle fries, since she suggested we share since the portions are big. I'm glad we shared we barely finished. The fries were really good and so was the burger. Everything was amazing but the onion rings really stood out to me. I can't wait to take guests here when we have visitors.\",\n",

A little ridiculous, but pretty amusing as a shameless fan of his outrageous TV shows. \\n\\nPrepare to wait at least 30-60 minutes for a table. If you're a party of 2, you can wait in line which goes fairly quickly. If you have 3+ in your party you have to leave your name down and wait for them to call you (no waiting in line). Singles can sit at the bar. \\n\\nI was in a party of 3 and we ended up sitting at the bar to avoid the wait. The seats were awkwardly far apart, but then again it wasn't built for big parties.

Ever.\\n\\nFirst impressions: Being in Vegas it\\'s got that upscale feel to it. We had a short line when we got there, about a 15 min. wait, and the giant interactive menu on the wall is sweet. The bar is very cool with the ice wall behind the taps, and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy.\\n\\nService: Service was excellent! The bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. Love the iPad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions. Draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.\\n\\nFood: We ordered the Farm burger, Euro burger and the Brittania, and they were every bit as amazing as I was hoping they\\'d be. The burger patties themselves were out of this world. Cooked perfectly to order. Moist and tender on the inside, and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew. The blend of cuts was awesome, and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar. The natural taste of the beef really shined through, and the fact that they\\'re grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just can\\'t get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.\\n\\nA burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own, with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein, and that was definitely the case here.\\n\\nThe Farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious. The Brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it. My personal favorite was the Euro burger. The goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top. In each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.\\n\\nThe jalapeno poppers were really good, as were the onion rings. The chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty. I wish I could\\'ve brought a bottle of that stuff home with me.\\n\\nIs it more expensive than most other burgers? Yes. Is it overpriced? No.\\nCould you find bigger, heavier burgers? Yes. Is it any less satisfying? No.\\n\\nSome people have this idea that the more a burger costs, the bigger it should be. Uh, no. The more it costs the BETTER it should be. If all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money, walk down the street to Fatburger, or find some fast food chain. But you get what you pay for, so if you want quality, if you want the absolute best burger in Vegas, and certainly one of the best anywhere, Gordon Ramsay\\'s BurGR is the place to be.\\n\\nI\\'m just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay, or nothing special, etc. Those people have no idea what they\\'re talking about.',\n",

The truffle fries are a concoction of beautifully presented fries with a generous sprinkling of light Parmesan fluffs (for lack of a better word) mixed with freshly chopped herbs, and truffle, of course! Love it! I could probably have an order to myself although it's big enough (and expensive enough) to share.\\nThe dessert combinations are also stellar, with delicious milkshakes topped with a wonderful pudding. It sounds weird, but imagine a milkshake topped with a somewhat chocolate mousse-flavored topping. Awesome!!\\nThe only flaw we've ever found is once the dip for the fries had a skin on it from being prepared ahead of time. The dishes are starting to looking a bit beaten-up, but considering the high volume of people, understandable. They should swap it out, though, and the placemats are looking a bit raggedy for the image.\\nNot as much kid-friendly as Holstein's, no kids menu.

Stop with the kitchen nightmares and improve this place first! \\n\\nAs a huge MasterChef fan, I was really hoping BurGR would live up to its hype, but really everything is sooooo average and overpriced to boot. The patty is pretty tasteless with a weird texture, which is surprising given that I asked for it medium rare and it's supposed to be cooked over some smoky apple wood or something else exotic. Pretty sure all of the 5 stars are from people who have had one too many fat tuesdays (which is also in pH and a wayy better bang for your buck) \\n\\nOn the plus side, great service and cool menu design! The fries were pretty good and +1 HUGE star for the aioli that it came with.\",\n",
       " 'After all the hoopla about Gordon Ramsey, we decided to give this place a try - BIG MISTAKE !!!  Definitely not one of the top 100 places to eat in Las Vegas.  The service was poor, the coffee was cold, and the food was expensive and not worth the price.  Definitely will never come back here for a meal.',\n",

The attire is in my option inappropriate for the food service industry as the dress hit right under the girls butt cheeks, let me tell you none of the girls would be able to bend over without showing you a full moon. I get that it is Vegas but a inch or two longer would still meet with Brittney Spears approval.\\n2. Service and friendliness was lacking in our experience. We were never asked how the food was, never asked if we would like water and had to wait thirty minutes for our food.\\n3. About twenty minutes to get in and about thirty minutes for food after you order that's long when you are hungry so plan ahead for that.\\n I was not impressed enough to go back.\",\n",

I'm not sure if it was because it was in the casino rather than the shops, but this place is no where to be found on the map when you enter through the parking garage. The concierge was there to help me find my way :) (walk towards urban outfitters/Las Vegas Blvd and enter that casino entrance. Then it'll be to your left).\\n\\nSo glad there was a sign that stated if you had a party of ___ or more head to the hostess stand, rather than them making you wait in line. We had a party of 9, 35-40 wait which was expected, and they offered to text us when our table was ready. I love that feature! We were able to shop around beforehand.\\n\\nThe restaurant is well decorated with a HUGE fire sculpture that talks up a whole wall in front. The tables seem to be pretty close each other, but very big with comfortable spacious seating. Give and take! I loved the menu presentation and the selection of burgers, fries, and appetizers- Very Gordon Ramsay! \\n\\nWe tried a little of everything: sweet potato fries, gooey fries, regular fries, truffle fries, hells kitchen burger, euro burger, salads, & American burger. \\n**my favorites were the truffle fries, and euro burger! However the Hell's Kitchen burger is also full of flavor, and the gooey fries are heaven when it comes to cheese loaded French fries! Careful, some people say the burgers are small. I thought it was, until I realized I was full from fries and had to take half of my burger home! \\n\\nThe only thing they could have done better was work on getting food out at the same time. Our server had gotten all food out except for one (which was the salad) which left us waiting to eat, and she forgot a couple drinks/refills. But once everything was out, service went smoothly. \\n\\nPS. They do things for birthdays! The birthday boy got a cool ice cream/cake push pop with a lit candle for us to celebrate!\",\n",

We tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger (perfect blend of ingredients, spice level, and texture), the pork sandwich (large and flavorful), Maui onion rings (best onion rings I've had, dipping sauces were great), regular fries (thick cut, overly salted, served with fantastic homemade ketchup), and the wings (sweet and spicy, well presented).  The service varied.  The first time we were there, we sat at a high top and our server was friendly, attentive, and laid back in a good way.  He checked in regularly.  The second visit we were seated at the table right next to where the servers punch in their orders and keep the water pitchers.  We always had someone zooming inches from the table or standing next to it which seemed distracting.  Both times there was a line outside the door with about a 30 minute wait however there were many empty tables inside, not being filled.  I'm not sure if the line is for image or if they aren't staffed enough to manage the amount of tables they have in the dinning areas.  Regardless, the wait is worth it.\",\n",

When my burger came out in front of me, it looked tiny and I noticed char all around the edges....I knew it wasn't MR.  I took a bite, and found it to be well done.  \\n\\nAsked for another to replace it, and the second time around was a super juicy, perfectly cooked MR with lots of juices hitting the plate.  Way better than my first visit here actually....but it took them a second try to cook it right!   It seems like the consistency might become a problem here...hopefully I am wrong.  I would order this one again, but I think I still prefer the farm burger.\\n\\nThe parmesan truffle fries are still the BEST thing evar.  I have had them on 3 separate occasions, and still hold them to be my MOST favorite french fry of all time.\\n\\nAlso, service was not nearly the same as the first time around.  My waitress let my drinks go dry every single time, with me asking for refills each time, and disappeared when my check arrived after I immediately put my $100 on the table to wait for change.\\n\\nThe busperson was the one to pull my plates, refill my water the majority of the time, and actually took my bill to get me change because he noticed me standing up in the restaurant, waiting to leave.  The server was not good at her job, and if I was rating off of service alone, we would be at 2 stars.  \\n\\nI hope next visit goes smoothly.

Mine was probably the best burger that i can remember. Fries were also good. Not a big fan of the chipolte ketchup or the curry ketchup.

This is by far the most affordable of them all and it shows. For starters there is a line halfway around the strip to get in here. There was no way in hell I was waiting 1+hrs for a burger Gordon or not. Luckily we managed a seat at the bar so we got right in. The staff is busy busy busy so don't expect great and personable service. They will do their job and nothing extra. The food is just okay, but this is a burger place so what were you expecting? The noise level is through the roof so be prepared to scream to the person across the table from you if you want conversation. Honestly the best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding which my wife got for dessert. It came in a pushpop style with ice cream which is different from his other locations. Honestly if you want a cheap Gordon Ramsay meal this is where you will get it. If you want a gourmet meal from a celebrity chef 1. be prepared to pay for it and 2. there are a TON of them in Vegas do your homework, but don't come here for gourmet.\\n\\nWhat works: Some pretty good food\\n\\nWhat to improve: Table turnover\",\n",

However, I am a saucy person so I had to use some of the sauces from the onion rings we ordered. \\nI definitely recommend getting the gooey fries. They are beyond delicious. Just don't fill yourself up on that before your food comes! \\nThe beer battered onion rings are super crispy. Usually anything beer battered is a lot more heavy and dense but I love how the batter wasn't thick. The ketchup mix was delicious. \\nWe also had the sweet potato fries. It was sweet. The honey mayo was interesting but still delicious. I applaud them for making such good sauces. \\nThe only disappointing part is that you can see all of the kegs but there is no specialty beer. All the beer on tap is just like the typical bottled beer everyone serves. \\nI already want it again after I just had it the other day.\",\n",

The food was awesome I had the Farm Burger, duck breast bacon, over easy egg, cooked to perfection just the way I ordered it which leads  me to the service I received. Our server, Alex with the glasses, was the BOMB he was on point with the service he provided me and my family. He gave us plenty of time to order and answered all questions we had about the menu, he knew the menu front and back and had us tasting the food without actually eating it. He kept are glasses full and checked on us regularly making sure everything was as it was suppose to be. I cannot give Alex enough credit because this was New Years Eve and he was extremely busy with all his customers and yet took a little extra time to converse and joke with my family. The food was great ,but the service was better props to Alex and the general manager for the staff he has at his restaurant. I will definitely be back with my family in the future and be sure to let others know to ask for Alex with the glasses for excellent service when they visit this place.',\n",

I got the farm burger which I've had a few times before and love. Grin on my face ready to sink into this delicious burger to disappointment. It was bland! duck bacon, and egg, and good beef, yet bland wtf? I couldn't taste any seasoning on the meat and it tasted closer to a fast food burger than a gourmet burger. We opted for normal fries this time, which I havent tried since we usually do the parmasean ones and maui onion rings. The fries were luke warm too and came with 2 sides of curry tasting ketchup? didnt care for the ketchup at all, asked for ranch and the first server never came back with it when I asked. Had to ask a 2nd server after being nearly done with my burger at this point and the fries were cold by the time I got the ranch.The bill came and it was roughly $30 a person with tax and tip for a really meh experience. I really hope they get there stuff back in order. This was one of my favorite burgers in Vegas, but with so much competition it's just as easy to go somewhere else for a burger fix.\",\n",
       " \"The food here was amazing, however the low review is due to the terrible hostesses (multiple bad ones). First of all, my partner, a concierge, called to make a reservation for a party of 6. He was told they don't take reservations but you can come in person and put your name on a list for a certain timeframe. He walked over there and they said they can't take the reservation till everyone's there, which wouldn't be for another 4 hours. When he told them about the hostess giving out wrong information as a courtesy to them, they were rude and disrespectful. Now when we got there, we waited for our table for almost 2 hours. Even after are name was called (or texted) the rude hostess yelled at us to stand in a very specific area because apparently she was overwhelmed with her side conversations. So we waited another 10 minutes after our name was called and got to listen to the hostesses complain about customers aka the people who fill there paychecks. IF YOU ARE IN A CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY, YOU SHOULDNT COMPLAIN ABOUT  CUSTOMERS BECAUSE YOU WOULDNT HAVE A JOB WITHOUT THEM, just saying! But the waiter we had was very kind and tried to be helpful while reciting a 2 minute long introduction that he clearly spent a lot of time memorizing. Both the appetizers and the entrees were absolutely amazing. I would recommend this restaurant if you simply just want a delicious meal and nothing more. Not a great dining experience, date, birthday, or any special event, just some really good food.\",\n",

       " 'VERDICT: A very juicy burger served as dryly as possible that makes you question the very nature of existence in the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria in hell.\\n\\nThis is Gordon Ramsey\\'s burger joint in Planet Hollywood in Vegas.  I don\\'t usually review Strip restaurants, because it is usually overpriced tourist trap fare.  I figure that BurGR would provide, at the very least, a unique burger experience.  I had cousins visiting to watch a hockey game and was given the parameters that they wanted a burger or steak.  It was a perfect opportunity to try BurGR.\\n\\nFirst, you are greeted with an artistic wall of fire where you wait to be seated.  Nothing is more welcoming after being in the 115 degree summer heat than a nice hot furnace to stand by.  I guess this is some sort of German existential performance art piece.  You get to experience the horror of Hell\\'s Kitchen.  The pain, the suffering, the agony I suppose only add to the culinary experience.  You must suffer before you know pleasure.  Make sure to be seated in the \"No Exit\" section for a full sensory experience.\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  I would describe the decor as \"newly decorated hospital cafeteria in the seventies\".  Which I think is in vogue?  I don\\'t know.  Of course, there are televisions broadcasting all the latest in sports, because the world caters to sports lovers and sports are one of two things you\\'ll ever see on televisions in restaurants.  The only other thing being, of course, menus.\\n\\nThe burgers did take a while, but that was to be expected.  One of my cousins ordered a plain burger with nothing on it, which leads me to believe that he gets the whole German existential culinary experience better than I do.  I got a burger with fancy cheeses on  it.  We also split two orders of fries.  So, 4 burgers, two fries, and three sodas came to over $90.\\n\\nI have a hard time describing the burger, because it was both good and bad...like life.  This would be ideal if I was taking a course in philosophy, but I wanted an all over good burger, not one sprinkled with the bitter disappointments of a life spent in agonizing self-contemplation.  The meat portion was perfection.  I truly have not had a burger patty done to such high standards ever before.  The bun, however, was dry.  I don\\'t mean just without condiments, I mean dry like it had built-in desiccant.  Any juiciness of the burger was offset by the moisture destroying sponges on the top and bottom.  My saliva was not enough.  I found I needed to down food with water.\\n\\nThe fries were unexceptional.  The garlic Parmesan fries did little in the way of flavor.  They were basically a regular order of fries with a sprinkle of Parmesan and garlic on the top, definitely not worth the extra money.  The fries came with different condiments, one of which was curry ketchup, a staple in many European countries and a condiment that just can\\'t seem to make it in the United States.\\n\\nI\\'m mixed as to whether to recommend this restaurant or not.  I feel it\\'s great if you want an expensive total sensory German existential philosophy adventure making you see through the veil-covered illusion that is life.  Or if you got the money, try it once.',\n",

       " \"Ummm not as good as I expected. I honestly don't think the burgers were as good, the wings were decent, ketchup was weird, the fish and fritz were great though. Prices are decent. Would recommend it just to try it out but not my personal favorite place for burgers.\",\n",
       " 'Finally got to try a jordan ramsey restaurant and the Fury wings are delish! Best part was the lovely manager hooking us up cuz we had to wait forever for them wings. Burgers were good their meat was soo moist and tender.  Oh man the parmesan truffle fries were good especially with the chipotle ketchup.... Ugh mouth wateringly good.',\n",

       " 'Everything about this place reeks of Vegas: hot chics waitresses who show off their pretty young boobs, pretty boy waiters who chat and flirt with their fellow employees as the food in the kitchen sits, and waits....and waits.....and waits to be served. \\n\\nOk, I ordered an American burger medium rare with fries and a beer. I was placed up front by the kitchen and could watch the dudes in the back making the orders. The food looked and smelled great! Alright, I was excited and ready to eat!\\n\\nBut the orders, after being made, just sat there where the cooks placed the food. So many plates would fill up the area that they ran out of room to place them there; they\\'d start to shuffle the plates around to any available area.\\n\\nI got my \\'burgr\\' and it was of good quality, but it was cold and not very appetizing. I told the airhead, pleasantly busty boobed waitress and all she could say was, \"Um, ok. But its good, right? I mean, its cold, but its good, right?\"\\nReplying that it was cold and not what I wanted from a \\'burgr\\', she told me that I had ordered it medium rare and maybe that\\'s why it was cold. Hmmm........I gave up and tried the manager.\\n\\nLong story short, I chewed her out and got another \\'Burgr\\' that was good, but after all the hassle I had to go through to get a decent meal I say screw this overhyped, inefficiently ran celebrity chef dumphole.\\n\\nAND, after this experience, I decided not to try any more Gordon Ramsay restaurants during my trip to Vegas.',\n",
       " 'LOVE This place.  As a conisuer of burgers this is at the top of my list.  The service was good,  can be a while upon getting food.  The drinks were awesom, and the food had me savoring every bite.  I shared a burger,truffle fries, and vear batter onion rings which were Amazin!!;as well as the sauce for fries.  It should ve bottles if ot already isnt.  Im just saying.  I would recommend this for those looking for a hearty vurger,beer or spe ialtu drink with fries.',\n",
       " \"I was excited to try another GR restaurant in Vegas, but I was fairly disappointed. I tried one of their shakes first and I had to send it back (our server very graciously took it off the check)...a milkshake topped with room temp pudding sounded good on paper, but in reality it was terrible. The Hog burger was ok and my husband liked his Hell's Kitchen burger, but the parmesian truffle fries were the best part of the meal. I can't say I will be back to this one, but his steak restaurant at the Paris is amazing, so I'm still a GR fan.\",\n",
       " 'One if by land, two if by sea.  Sunday, January 27th, 2013 was the day of the British Invasion, the day Gordon Ramsay would take Vegas by storm.  I decided this would be the ideal day to give BurGR another chance.  Let me tell you, the British must have come by sea, because two was the magic number.\\n\\nThe following is the review of BurGR that should have been penned the first time.\\n\\nCarved between separate halls of bustling casino exists a whimsically designed yet decidedly masculine cafe.  The eatery is home to the applewood grill and culinary delights of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, a fact that cannot be forgotten due to the grand scale of pictorial homage.  Seated in the restaurant one cannot help but be reminded of a subtle cross between Hell\\'s Kitchen and The F-Word.\\n\\nThe drink menu comes via Ramsay\\'s staple iPad, there is a wide array of potables from the tabs of the tablet.  But since in Ramsay\\'s restaurant, I decided to sample his favorite brew, Innis and Gunn a Scottish style ale aged in re-coopered barrels from alternating rum/whiskey sources.  The taste is sublime and soon our starter plate of hummus arrives to accompany the beer.  Ramsay\\'s salt and pepper hummus is a little more garlic and salt than pepper but the bread is warm and fresh and the vegetable offerings conduct the hummus into a symphony for the palate.\\n\\nNext up, the Hell\\'s Kitchen and Uber Cheese burgers arrive at the table.  The medium-rare temperature is a little more like medium but the patties have not lost their flavor.  The grilled jalapeno, avocado, and tomato team up on the Hell\\'s Kitchen and complete their dinner service in style.  The Uber Cheese has three different types and styles of cheese together, from fontina to goat the cheese is undoubtedly the star of this burger.  Lost or overpowered are any subtlety in the cooking process, all that is left is a delicious sandwich fit for anyone braving the treacherous days and nights of Las Vegas.  The \"Just Fries\" are as billed, they come accompanied with Chipotle ketchup and Curry ketchup that are both made in house.  \\n\\nThe dessert menu is simple as is most of the menu really.  You can have your choice of flavor of pudding milkshake, or sticky toffee pudding push-pops which arrived at our table only moments after the burgers had been cleared.  The push-pop is a novel and flavorful package for sticky toffee pudding.  The salted peanut ice cream is devine and is a perfect mate for the sweet toffee pudding layers.\\n\\nThe most impressive piece of BurGR is not the decor, the location or even the food or drinks.  Ramsay has nailed the service experience at BurGR.  The servers are eager and knowledgeable.  They are impeccably dressed in GR labelled gear.  The hostess stand is state of the art with iPads and text message table notification.  The manager stopped by our table and was friendly and gracious.  This level of quality experience may be what sets this \"burger joint\" apart from all other \"burger joints\" in Vegas.\\n\\nWell Done',\n",
       " \"The wait was exhausting and the food could have been better.  I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, which was average;  I was expecting a lot of flavor,  which it lacked.  The bun was fresh, I am expecting a burger that will make me want to come back and order it again, sadly that was not the case,  and the host could have been a little more friendly.\",\n",
       " \"I've always wanted to try Chef Ramsey's restaurant and was exactly as expected... It was great! really packed but worth the wait. The meat was perfectly cooked and the servers were really nice and professional. My entrees were out but my appetizer didn't come out so they offered to take my entrees back and re cook them and bring them out after my appetizers had been served. Never had service like this. Only bad thing is the line is really long. The burgers look really small but its actually really filling. Don't get fooled\",\n",
       " \"I have now been here twice, both times being consistent. It's better to come for lunch or odd hours because this place can have quite a line outside sometimes.\\n\\n The burgers come out pretty quick, done exactly the way you order them and are thick and super juicy. They have an impressive amount of beer on draft and always ice cold. There's also a good amount of tvs with sports on, if that's your thing. Make sure to save room for one of the pudding shakes. I've never had anything like it and the pudding the milkshake is topped with is probably the best I've ever had.\",\n",
       " \"I've visited during my last two trips to Vegas. \\n- On July 3 2013 the experience was so-so but I attributed the stomachache to the fact that I had been drinking at the pool that day. \\n- On December 19 2013 I went back, because I did remember the bartenders and bar scene being quite fun. This time around I got a stomachache again and it is definitely the poor food!\\n\\nProblems: \\n- The American Burger is served with PROCESSED CHEESE like from a Kraft package! Disgusting! \\n- The Jalapeno Poppers are served with a sauce that was so heavy, it was really a downer. \\n- The plates are scratched and in poor condition. Like a Denny's from the MidWest. \\n\\nIf Gordon Ramsey were to eat here and the logos were changed, he'd SLAM this place and send it straight to the depths of hell's kitchen.\",\n",
       " 'The food and drinks are delicious. I personally would recommend getting the popcorn as an appetizer . It was made to perfection!',\n",
       " 'I have sort of been on a mission to try all of the best burger places in Vegas so I decided to check out Gordon Ramsey\\'s.  I did not care about the long wait or the terrible service or the high price as that is all pretty standard in Vegas....... but I was really disappointed in the food.  Mediocre would be being kind to be honest.  I have found most of the top end burger places to be pretty similar in quality so I was really surprised at how bad it was.  If the positive reviews of this place from others are true it seems at a minimum they are not consistent as no amount of positive thinking could have salvaged my dry little burger with just a sprinkle of Blue Cheese off on one half (just barely enough to justify calling it a Blue Cheese Burger) and an unhappy looking piece of arugula.  It was so dry and bland that I had to specially ask for some catchup (as none is available) just to liven it up.  It was the first time I put catchup on a so called \"gourmet\" burger in my life.  If I had gotten it  a food court somewhere I would have thought nothing of it...... but it does not even approach some the best gourmet burgers in Vegas.',\n",

       " \"After a horrible service at the Sugar Factory, we moved to BurGR and loved it.  It was definitely expensive, however the whole experience was top notch.  \\n\\nFrom the start we were very impressed with their wait system to be seated. They take your cell phone and will txt you when your table is ready.  We had very little of a wait, but it was a nice touch that we could go stand out and enjoy the fresh air on the strip while we waited.\\n\\nWe had high expectations and although I'm not sure how, they surpassed them.  We eat out a lot and like simple food, so you could say my family are experts at burgers and fries.  We loved the food.  I heard several times from my wife and kids that the burgers were the best they've ever had.  My wife loved the Garlic Parmesan with truffle  sauce.  \\n\\nI had read about the sticky toffee pudding desert at another Ramsay restaurant so I ordered those for all of us and everyone loved them.  Their staff was a treat to be with also as they were friendly and top of things, including bringing refills before they were needed.\\n\\nBurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food.  It's no wonder why Gordon Ramsay is so successful as he makes his places the best hands down.\",\n",
       " \"Went to Gordon Ramsay BurGR last week while in Vegas because my wife and I are fans of Mr. Ramsay and thought this was definitely one of the cheaper Gordon Ramsay options.  We went around 1130 and didn't have to wait.  The atmosphere was AWESOME.  Our server immediately came to the table and took our drink order.  After coming back to the table the server brought an IPAD to the table which serves as the drink, dessert menu which was a pretty nice touch.  \\n\\nI had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my wife had the American Burger.  The fries are not included so we ordered the fries as a side.  Our food came fast and was presented nicely on the plate.  My burger was definitely the BEST I have ever had and the fries were hot and crispy but not greasy!  \\n\\nI wouldn't pay $37 at home for two burgers and an order of fries but on vacation why not!  Gordon Ramsay fan or not the place is AWESOME!!!\",\n",
       " \"A mediocre burger joint. If I would go back to  Vegas and eat at one of GR's restaurants, I would go back to the pub at ceasars or the steakhouse in paris instead of this one. I find the staff here a bunch of snobs. The fries aren't even the best. The shakes are too thick to drink out of the straw. Just a little disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"This was my 3rd time eating at BurGr and was the best experience yet. The food was great, but the service was exceptional. It's a pleasure eating at a restaurant that obviously trains their staff well. Our server Ashley was knowledgable, with a great personality and she gave us outstanding service. Even the food runners were great, describing each dish as they served it.\",\n",
       " 'I probably had way too unrealistic expectations for this place. Needless to say, the meal was still a bit mind-blowing. We had to deal with a ~30 minute wait to get seated (Saturday lunch around noon), but after everything went swimmingly. \\n\\nI pigged out a bit and got a Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger, Shake #5 (coffee & chocolate hazelnut), and shared some fries with my friends. The burgers are extremely well thought out (and they damn well should be, coming from a chef who recently said a \"Burger would be number one\" as a dish that everyone should know how to cook on his IAmA on Reddit).The avocado, butter lettuce, and patty all mixed together extremely well. We ordered a collection of fries (parm, yam, loaded), and ALL of them were excellent. Honestly, I think the fries are the thing that BurGR does best. The shake was also really, really good - I loved the mix of coffee & chocolate hazelnut. \\n\\nGordon Ramsay, thanks for the awesome meal!',\n",
       " 'LIKES: food, service, use of technology, value\\nDISLIKES: the server\\'s outfits\\n\\n[Background:]\\nWent here in December 2013 with my boyfriend, before a show. We made no reservations at 8 p.m., but the wait was less than 10 minutes.  We also had a Total Rewards card that gave us a dollar off each menu item --- score! \\n\\nThis restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood. Very easy to find as it is on The Strip. \\n\\nThe ambiance was warm and very casual. Other diners were young, old, purple and blue --- everyone is welcome. \\n\\nBUT, I didn\\'t really like the servers\\' uniforms. It was a weird sporty look with sneakers. I thought something more classic (collared shirt? Nice pants? A mid-length skirt?) would\\'ve projected a casual vibe too. It was a bit more McDonald\\'s for me...Oops. Don\\'t think they were going for that.\\n\\n[Food:]\\nGot a suggestion from our server to choose the Farm Burger. And my boyfriend did! I picked the Hells Kitchen burger to try their house special.\\n\\nMy boyfriend deemed the Farm Burger \"the best\" he\\'s ever tasted. Ever. And he loves burgers. It was the perfect taste, great meat to bread to everything else in between ratio.\\n\\nThe Hells Kitchen burger was probably the best I\\'ve ever tasted too, and I am not usually a burger eater. It was very easy to enjoy, a light burger yet very savoury. I couldn\\'t finish it though, so I had half of it the next day. Still tasted delicious---and I am very picky.\\n\\nThe burgers, however, do not come with fries. You order that separately. We got the Hawaiian onion rings instead. These were so amazing --- batter was light and the portions were huge! It didn\\'t make us feel sick of eating onion rings after the 1038th bite.\\n\\n[Service:]\\nExcellent! Just the perfect amount of friendliness. Our servers (we had a change up in the middle of our service) were so casual, yet very professional. We didn\\'t feel intimidated even though it was Gordon Ramsay\\'s restaurant! Ha. Ha. Ha. The REAL Gordon Ramsay. Well, he would\\'ve been proud since he was well-represented by his people at BURGR.\\n\\nLoved the use of technology too! There was an iPad presented to us to look over the drinks and appies. We also got to rate our experience for the night via an iPhone attached to the receipt folder thing. Very innovative.\\n\\n[Value:]\\nOkay. Confession: We got a souvenir...for free! We kept the menus. Oops. The server said we could. I swear! We were so excited over the fact that we ate at this restaurant that the server said we should keep the menus as souvenir. That\\'s pretty good value!\\n\\nOh, the food & drinks were obviously great value too! We ended up paying about $50 plus tips for two gourmet burgers, two beers and onion rings. Not bad at all! And full, we were. Very.\\n\\n[Verdict:]\\nLOVE IT. You must go! It has set the standards for all of my burger consumption from here on. Totally lived up to Gordon Ramsay\\'s name...and now I heart Gordon even more.',\n",
       " \"Well you just have to try somewhere with the name Gordon Ramsey on it, even if they can't spell burger!  And try it you well should because it's darn good!\\n\\nThis has a modern and relatively pleasant interior.  The menu design is amazing, anyone opening it is just stunned, you see it on everyone's faces.  In some ways it's a bit much, this is not your moms burgr place!\\n\\nHowever food is of course the main thing of importance.....\\n\\nI got the special Gordon Burger.  I felt this to be an original name for a special in a, well, Gordon Ramsey burger place.  Duck bacon, pork burger. Real English cheddar, arugula lettuce, avocado, peppers. Delectable and I mean one of the best burgers I've ever had, the duck bacon is just awesome and flavorful beyond belief, but the whole combination is true bliss - mind blowing!\\n\\nSide of onion rings - best I've ever had, thank you England!  Great ketchup too as only is to be expected.  Hello, knock knock - great onion rings and awesome ketchup does it get better than this?\\n\\nService too was pretty good, but I'd go for the food alone with this one.\",\n",
       " \"Love Burgr. I find service hit or miss here, but then again it does it insanely busy at times so that really can't be helped. I always order the American and we share a fires and find that more than enough for dinner. Portion sizes are decent and delicious and definitely worth the wait outside to get in! We go whenever we are in Vegas. It's just that good! :)\",\n",
       " 'We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian.',\n",

       " \"Amazing food! My wife and I noticed it walking down the strip, and beings fans of Gordon Ramsey, decided to give it a go. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Saturday evening. The environment inside the restaurant is a lot of fun, but not too crazy. The waiter was very fast and professional, he knew the menu very well and gave outstanding recommendations. The beer batter onion rings are to die for, cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and comes with a really nice ranch and barbeque dipping sauce. The burgers were amazing. Juicy, but didn't have that nasty, gritty greasy texture that 99.9% of burgers out there have. The chicken burger was very good as well. Finally, top it off with an Oreo shake. The shake was so smooth and creamy, and at the same time wasn't so rich it would make your mouth raw. Overall, or experience it was top of the line, and is definitely on our favorite list for when we come back to Vegas next time!\",\n",

Service, atmosphere, food - everything was perfect and an amazing deal!\\n\\nBoth nights we went late at night, knowing there would be a lineup for dinner, but the lineup is still there at 10pm! So be prepared to wait at any point during the day because the restaurant is pretty much always packed! \\n\\nWe got the fish and crisp sandwich both nights - the tartar sauce is to die for and the fish is done perfectly, crispy on the outside and still so juicy on the inside. For someone who doesn't like/eat beef I'd say this is the best option. The other highlight were the sweet potato fries. Since we saw a bunch of people ordering them on the first night, we decided to give them a go on the second night. Definitely don't regret that at all! It comes with honey jalapeno mayo which honestly isn't spicy at all, even coming from someone who eats almost no spice at all.\\n\\nPrice-wise, this place is completely reasonable, if not a good deal. For excellent, gourmet burgers and an amazing environment, their prices and quality are definitely better than other a la carte restaurants in this and nearby hotels! \\n\\nService was great and the food came very quickly for such a busy and packed restaurant! I'd definitely recommend checking this place out (at least once) during a visit to Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"Was super excited to have lunch here today. I've been a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay as well as Christina for as long as I could remember. He was the one who inspired me to cook and love food so this was huge for me. The servers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and provide impeccable service.\\n\\nI started off with the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings. They were perfectly cooked, nice and crisp on the outside but a little too sweet and salty. They went overboard with the Parmigiano-reggiano. Just a little for the flavor would have been nice but with that much on it, they were too salty.\\n\\nThe Truffle Burger is just what the name sounds like, a beautifully cooked burger with loads of truffle coming through. It is definitely a special occasions burger. My only problem with it is that is was way to rich and after a point that was just too much for the palate. This is probably because it is loaded with the foie gras crème fraîche, the truffle aïoli and some truffle tremor cheese. (#indulgence)\\n\\nI guess the combination was wrong and I should have ordered the spicy Hell's Kitchen Burger with the Onion rings or maybe a spicy side with the Truffle Burger since these were both very rich in the end a little overwhelming. I would have really liked it if the server had suggested this to me while I was ordering it, but then again, I guess that's not really his job. \\n\\nIs it the best burger I ever had? Probably not. It's definitely pricey because you're paying for the brand but it's just one of those indulgent moments every Ramsay fanboy has to experience at least once. \\n\\nOverall I loved the place and would definitely recommend it to my friends.\",\n",

Being a server myself, out of common courtesy it would've been nice if our first server told us that his shift ended and someone else would be taking care of us.

Not bad but $14 for 6 pieces!? *eye roll* As for the burgers, my sister went with the Hog Burger & I chose the Chanterelle Burger. Both of our burgers were overcooked. The only two good things were my Mojito & the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Definitely overpriced for burgers. I guess paying $15-$18 a burger is normal in Vegas.\",\n",

I give this place 4 stars because:\\n\\n+truffle fries and the sauces are to die for!!\\n+waiter was very kind and patient and knowledgeable of the menu\\n+I tried the euro burger, which is delicious if you like goat cheese. I think it really brings out the medium rare taste of the meat.

If you go with a party of 3 or more, walk right up to the desk and let the host know.  They will text you when your table is ready so you won't have to wait in line.  If you go by yourself or are a party of 2, flash your platinum Total Rewards card and up and get priority seating.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of the place is pretty casual and open.  The front of the place does open out into the casino so the place does get a little loud sometimes.  I think the only downside of the place is that some of the seating is not as intimate and you feel like you're just an arm length away from the next table if you're not sitting in a booth.  Also the seats for some reason are super close to the ground which is weird.  You feel like you need a booster seat.  It is definitely not a place to sit for those with hip/knee replacements and such.  There is bar seating for those who don't want to sit so close to the ground.  In addition, there is no bathroom inside the restaurant so you would have to walk out of the restaurant and use the casino's bathroom which is directly across from the restaurant.  Remember, the restaurant is inside the casino so it's not like you're having to make a long trek to the bathroom or even step outside onto the strip.  You are still inside the casino and you are literally just taking a couple steps to go to the bathroom.  It is really no biggie.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, obviously this is mainly a burger joint since the name of the restaurant is BurGR after all.  There are also side snacks and dishes to order such as roasted jalapeno poppers, shakes, truffle parmesan fries, fresh roasted chili dawgs, and so much more!  I have eaten at this restaurant many times and I can honestly say that I have tried close to most of the burgers on the menu including the one that was the special for the day and I have enjoyed everything so far.  The burger that I recommend ordering is the Hell's Kitchen Burger!  After you have eaten this burger, it will probably ruin all burgers for you after that.  I wasn't a big burger fan coming to this restaurant and the Hell's Kitchen Burger did it for me.  It is a yummy burger that is made up of a patty that has three different types of ground meat, fresh roasted buns, asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato.  For those who don't enjoy spicy foods, don't worry, the jalapeno peppers are not crazy spicy.  This burger is so good and packs so much flavor that you will not need any condiments!  The burger is also very juicy and is the perfect size.  It is not too little and not too big.  You can definitely order many burgers and cut it in half and share with others so you can sample all the burgers there.  If you don't know anything about Gordon Ramsay at all, know that he thinks beef should always be cooked medium rare.  You better speak up if you don't like your burgers cooked this way.\\n\\nAll of the burgers are really good, but obviously I'm biased and I think the real winner is the Hell's Kitchen burger.  As for the fresh roasted chili dawg, it honestly tasted like a regular hot dog with too much toppings and it didn't impress me too much.  The roasted jalapeno poppers tasted just like your regular poppers, but it is presented nicely in shot glasses and it's like playing a game of Russian roulette.  Out of all of the poppers, one is supposed to pack the most heat, but you won't know which one it is until you're all done sharing and eating them.  The parmesan fries come with two dipping sauces.  One is a truffle aioli and the other one looks like regular ketchup, but it isn't.  It almost tastes like there's curry or something mixed in there.  Anyway, the portion for this one is huge so make sure you bring a couple of people so you can share.\\n\\nThe food is a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for and it is worth the money!  The burgers usually range around $13 and up and the sides are usually around $11 and up.\\n\\nIf you are a member of Total Rewards, present your card to get discount on the meals as well as earn points.  You can sign up to become a member inside the casino before heading to BurGR to eat.\\n\\nThe food has been consistently amazing each time I have been here, but I can't say the same for the service.  Sometimes I've received excellent service and during other times, I've received just okay service.  One time, my bf and I received free Parmesan Truffle fries to make up for the food taking too long to come out.  We didn't even say anything, the waitress took it upon herself to give us the freebie.  I feel as though they really do try to give you the best experience and will go out of their way to do so.  One time we were seated at the bar and the service there was actually so much better compared to the tables.  I feel like the service here is a hit or miss.\",\n",
       " 'Two stars is for the service.\\n\\nThis past memorial day vegas trip, I only needed one thing - no, that wasn\\'t entry into clubs, free drinks, or a buffet... it was BurGR\\'s oreo milkshake :((\\n\\nI walked in the sweltering heat from Mandalay Bay to Planet Hollywood. I think it took about an hour as I tredged through the unsettling heat that is Vegas. I contemplated taking a taxi, however I figured the calories should be burnt off anyway.\\n\\nOnce Planet Hollywood finally came into view, my eyes widened and I was a very excited camper. Enter the hotel, and ask the security guys for directions to the beloved burger establishment. As I came near to the signature flames that encompass the brand, I realized that the one thing that I desperately wanted all year was about to be in my hands.\\n\\nI walked past the line, as I only planned to order togo. I asked the hostess, \"Hi, I want to place an order for togo?\" This was 9:15pm. Her answer? \"I\\'m sorry, we\\'re only doing togo orders at 10:15\".\\n\\nWhat the fuck. My heart dropped but I couldn\\'t really ask her why is that so, however as I write this review, maybe I should have brought it up with a manager - as I was a paying customer that risked my health in order to try to attain something four hours away from home. I couldn\\'t exactly wait an hour, as I had to go back and get ready for XS\\'s Night Swim. \\n\\nI begrudgingly cried out a, \"thank you\", and made my way the opposite direction. It\\'s an interesting feeling, turning your back against the thing you love. \\n\\nWHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Super sad panda.',\n",
       " 'It was good...I am not dying to go back or anything.  Once we were seated it took the waiter 20 minutes to get over to our table and just take drink orders...what in the world!!  The best part of the entire visit was seeing WWE Superstar \"RVD,\" cray cray...I was screaming!',\n",
       " \"don't let that line discourage you. we got in line where the rope seating hostess said approx 20 mins and it didn't too long before we got our table.\",\n",
       " \"First time here; definitely, can't go wrong with anything you order. Our group made a reservation hours prior and we still waited another 30 after our given time... But wasn't a big deal since the line was longer. \\n\\nOrdered the truffle burger with the gooey fries... Wow. It was the perfect size for one person. A buddy ordered the jalapeño poppers they had some heat and one of the 8 have pure seeds.. Careful. \\n\\nGreat experience for a well deserved food coma.\",\n",
       " \"Review 29 for 2017! \\n\\nI really enjoy coming here because it's quality food for a reasonable price! It's also conveniently located inside of Planet Hollywood so the Miracle Mile Shops and gambling area are just a hop and a skip away. If you're coming on the weekend, make sure to arrive early! There's always a line, but check to see if you can sit at the bar to skip the wait. \\n\\nTheir SHAKES blow everyone else's out of the water!!! I'm not sure what it is about them, but they're super tasty. I recommend sharing it with someone since the portion is on the bigger side. My favorite is shake #4! Creme brûlée pudding and Oreo shake. I just really like the creme brûlée pudding part. I don't think I've seen the flavor offered at any other restaurant. I also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger on the last visit and didn't regret it at all. They really don't skimp out on any of the ingredients. I also really liked the ketchup that came with our truffle Parmesan fries! \\n\\nService was great. Our server checked up on us frequently so no complaints there. \\n\\nOverall verdict: I will definitely come back!\",\n",
       " \"Always a sucker for burger and fries.  This place did not disappoint.  I got the Farm Burger because I like burgers with a fried egg.  My friend got the Hog Burger and that was good too.  My other friend got the Southern Yardbird Burger and I liked it more than mine.  I like my burgers with some veggies in it.  Nothing beats a burger with some nice crispy lettuce in it.  The mustard bbq sauce was a nice touch as well.  If my farm burger can some kind of sauce, it probably would have tasted better.\\n\\nNo burger is complete without french fries of course.  We got the truffle parmesan fries.  They were good considering I'm not a huge fan of truffle.  You can taste the truffle and it wasn't overpowering, so I liked it.  There was a lot of parmesan on it but you can just brush that off.  It came with truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup.  Those weren't bad but I love original ketchup.\\n\\nService was good.  Your server and busboy were both there to refill drinks and get anything you asked for.  They were on top of it with the refills.  The alcoholic drinks menu was on a iPad and the check came with an iPod for you to give your feedback, that was fancy.\\n\\nPrices are what you would expect in Vegas I think.  \\n\\nI would definitely go back but would probably get the Southern Yardbird Burger next time.\",\n",
       " \"Now that's a great burger! Really good meat and excellent bun. Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and was very impressed.\",\n",
       " \"Burger was way too overpriced! Me and my friend ordered 2 Hell's kitchen burgers, 1 truffle fries, and 2 glass of beers and the totlal came out to be 70 something including tax. Definitely not worth the money considering theres a lot of different cheaper alternatives considering theres many restaurants in vegas serving decent burgers. As for the burger, it was too underseasoned even though i liked the grilled jalapenos incorporated in a burger.\",\n",
       " \"Boyfriend and I shared a Hell's Kitchen Burger, a Farm Burger, and an order of sweet potato fries.\\nEverything was seasoned perfectly, had the right texture, and it is obvious that they use fresh, quality ingredients. \\nBurgers seem to be small, but they do fill you up.\\nStaff was very friendly, but service was super slow. \\nI personally didn't mind the slow service since I wasn't feeling well when we were seated. \\nAfter we placed the order, we planned to ask them to pack the food to-go when we see our server, but they took so long that I was feeling fine by the time they brought our food.\\nI am waiting to go back to Vegas for more of their burgers. Hopefully they won't take that long next time!\",\n",
       " \"I expected to hate this place, but I loved it.\\n\\nI'm not thrilled by the gourmet burger trend. And I am not a fan of Gordon Ramsay. I ate at his steakhouse at Paris and it did nothing to woo me. When I heard about Burgr, I honestly had no interest. As far as I was concerned it already had two strikes against it. I expected more of the same... all glory, but no guts. However, my husband had lunch there and had a highly enjoyable meal. He returned and again it was top notch, it was no fluke. So, he convinced me to give it a whirl.\\n\\nWe dined Sunday afternoon for lunch. Shortly after opening a line had already formed. We waited just a minute or two before we were welcomed and told that we could receive a text when a table was ready rather than waiting in line. It's a nice touch. We opted to wait it out near the bar since we were told it would be about ten minutes for seating for two.\\n\\nI admired the beer selection while we waited. A wall of taps is always a beautiful sight to see. I was also impressed with how much restaurant they were able to fit in the old poker room and total rewards booth. They really did a nice job with the space. \\n\\nSoon we were led to our table and we reviewed the menu. GR is plastered on the outside. This is the glory, I spoke of before. Fortunately, as I opened the menu I saw a glimmer of guts. The menu is simple. I adore restaurants that take the approach to do a few things and do them well. \\n\\nOur waiter welcomed us and apologized that the iPad drink menus were down, we were in need of rehydration so H2O is all we wanted anyhow so no love lost. We asked to get started with an order of the jalapeno poppers while we perused the menu. Instead of only one fiery surprise, we asked that they all be hot and he happily obliged.\\n\\nThe poppers arrived in individual shot glasses. No sharing of dipping sauce required. This was awesome. There were no popper jousting wars over the sauce and you could even double dip if you wanted. The poppers are coated with panko, which makes the breading light, crisp and crunchy and the best part is that they are filled with cheddar. I was thrilled they didn't ruin them with cream cheese. Cheddar is the way to go and these had robust flavor. The jalapenos were tender and not a drip of water or grease pooled inside. I like spicy so with the seeds they had a bold kick. It was the perfect popper. No joke.\\n\\nI wished another order was on its way, but I knew we had plenty yet to enjoy. We ordered the sweet potato and truffle fries. It's far too much for two, but I love sweet potato fries and the husband loves steak fries. Neither of us are usually to fond of the other. But these? They are an exception. I didn't use the powdered sugar and I could do without the jalapeno mayo because the sweet potato fries were just right on there own. Fried crisp, yet fluffy in the center and not the least bit greasy. I was in heaven. They even won over my husband because of the jalapeno mayo he loved the sweet and spicy mix. The truffle fries were intoxicating from the moment they arrived. The scent of truffle oil is unmistakable. I was afraid the fries might be soggy or goopy, but no crisp and fluffy. I'm usually hate on steak fries but these were pretty darn tasty, uniform with skins and maybe soaked in a salt water bath? I'm not sure of the secret that sets them apart, but well done. Homemade ketchup and black truffle aioli accompany the truffle fries, but no sauce is required.\\n\\nNow on to the burgers, the Chanterelle for him and Hells Kitchen for me. Now the chanterelle burger is misleading it comes with argula and figgy-onion jam, but the mushrooms are not the star, it's that figgy-onion jam that shines. The onions are so wonderfully carmelized the sweetness is stellar, imagine French onion soup wrapped in a soft chewy bun. The chanterelles earthy flavor was lost, but I'm not complaining as a whole it works. It was a fantastic burger! It's just that the figgy onion jam is undersold. \\n\\nMy Hells Kitchen was grilled to a perfect medium and had a great bun to meat ratio just like the Chanterelle, but it was the weakest link of the meal. Don't get me wrong it was a good burger with asadero cheese, avocado and jalapeno. But I wanted heat, with a name like Hell's Kitchen I was expecting a fiery bite, but it was a wimper. Heat didn't even register with my tastebuds. \\n\\nWe weren't planning to get dessert, but watching the shakes go by was too tempting especially after a second look at the menu. The Oreo shake was right up my husband's alley and the hazelnut and coffee was made for me. We took the shakes to go. They were the ideal cool treat for a hot day. Creamy and luscious from the pudding.\\n\\nPrices are on par with the gourmet burger joints, but this one actually warrants the price tag. Service was great even though the restaurant was slammed. Guts and glory, well played Burgr. Well played.\",\n",
       " \"Oh how I wish I could give this place a higher rating. Before heading to Vegas one of our top priorities was to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We chose this one due to our budget limitations ( I would have given my left eye to eat at Gordon Ramsey steak, but it was not in the cards).\\n\\nWe were seated quickly, and greeted promptly. The outside decor is to die for, so modern and cool. I did not like that it was open to the casino floor, but that can't really be helped. The menu was so fun, it opened in a way that I have never seen before (see pictures for reference). The drink menu was also intriguing and not too long, I hate being overwhelmed by 30 specialty cocktails.\\n\\nWe ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Parmesan Truffle Fries, as well as two Bourbon Lemonades. The highlight of our meals were our drink and our fries. I so desperately wanted to fall in love with the burger but the best adjective that I can come up with is soft. The bun was soft (like fast food), the patty was soft, avocado was soft, and the additional dressings were soft, I think you see the trend here....\\n\\nFor a place that is supposed to be all about the burger that is what I enjoyed the least. It was not satisfying, and I was sorely disappointed.\\n\\nNow for better things. If you go for nothing else, go for the fries and a cocktail. The truffle fries were mouth watering. There was cheese on every fry, and the truffle was not overpowering. On top of that they were served with a curry ketchup and an aioli that truly melts in your mouth. We are not talking mayo mixed with some garlic here, but rather whipped olive oil perfectly infused with herbs and spices. I was in awe. Our bourbon lemonades had the perfect balance of tart and sweet, and they complicated the fries wonderfully.\\n\\nWould I go back, YES!, just not for a burger.\",\n",
       " \"5th time being here always great food! Which the server was a little more attentive. Burger with super juicy and definitely try the jalapeno poppers! Definitely amazing!

Other than that it was pretty good.',\n",

We started the experience off by ordering drinks, they have this lemonade like drink that is very good. We ordered the piggies in blankets appetizer, it's pork belly wrapped in dough. It was amazing, I highly recommend although it is $14 for only 8 pieces. I ordered the American burger and truffle fries. The burger was perfectly seasoned and didn't need any condiments. The truffle fries are amazing, big enough to be shared between 2 people. It is a bit expensive but definitely worth the visit if you can make it. I definitely will be going back...\",\n",

The flavors are really unique with cheese and apple butter - husband is now a big fan of this burger.  We also shared the truffle parmesan fries - one order is enough for two.  They were really good, my only complaint would be all the parmesan is on top, so after you eat the first few fries, the rest are just plan French fries and I couldn't taste any truffle oil.  The prices are high, but the food is quality and not your run of the mill burger.\",\n",

It came with roasted tomatoes, roasted jalapeños, a jalapeño pesto aoli and I couldn't remember the name of the cheese! Being that I would never get those ingredients in a buger myself, I loved it so much! Everything complimented so well with each other. I finished my whole burger along with the best raspberry iced tea. I am so glad I got the Hell's Kitchen burger! My boyfriend had the all American burger n it was just as good as mines. I love the spices for the ketchup and alternative ways they make their burgers! Beautiful and delicious. Thank you to James our waiter!

However we saw two tables close together and they wouldn't allow us to switch seats. Their excuse is there's a rotation of some sort. Come on! The line is out the door. People will be flowing into regardless. Put a sour taste in my mouth really. Burger was good but sometimes customer service trumps the overall experience.\",\n",

Why is that a complaint? Well, they refill your same glass. So when this other random soda showed up, the straw looked used. Wrong table, we were sure. Kinda gross.\\n\\nOn to the food.. Sure it's a good burger. And the onion rings are really good, made with sweet Maui onions instead of the traditional yellow. But let's face it, you are paying for the brand name here.  Yes I would eat here again if I were with someone who wanted the experience, just as I did. But I wouldn't make it a point myself to go out of my way to come back because I know where to get great burgers at home. The sticky toffee pudding push pops were great though. I do recommend those.\",\n",

The burgers/fries were the best we have ever tasted! On leaving, I went up to the manager and thanked her for a wonderful evening, celebrating my oldest daughter's big day. I said the only thing that would make this better, would be to have her meet Chef Ramsay.

       " \"This restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan. I arrived on a Saturday night close to midnight. They closed at 2 am, but my wait for a party of two was still 20 minutes. If you had a party of 3+, you had to check with the hostess and wait was at least 30 minutes.  As of March 27, 2017, self parking here is free. The restaurant doesn't have restrooms, but they're just outside close to the hotel entrance. You have to leave the restaurant and then come back in. \\n\\nConveniently, there was a scroll down menu while we were waiting in line. The actual menu once you are seated was pretty neat. It featured Gordon's face on it, fit neatly on the napkin, and opened up with the menu inside. The hostess and server were friendly; I have no complaints on their service.  I guess they were busy because our drinks took a while and the food took even longer.  I opted for the fries and onion rings to be brought out with the burger, but the burgers came out first. \\n\\nI had the Euro burger, which featured arugula and tomato.  The patty was perfectly medium rare and a generous size.  The garlic aioli was definitely there; they are pretty generous with their flavors.  The truffle fries were not what I expected - I thought they'd be shoestring fries. Instead they were hard, dry steak fries and were only edible with their chipotle ketchup.  The onion rings were better.  My eating partner had a Gordon burger, which was not on the menu.  He enjoyed the turkey bacon, but I don't think it was worth $21. \\n\\nWill I be back? Yep, it was nice to try for a first time, and it's casual enough where you don't have to dress to impress.  I haven't been to Gordon's three other restaurants in Vegas, so I look forward to trying those in the future!\",\n",

We had heard about the Parmesan truffle fries, so we ordered those, but could not ignore the Gooey Fries on the menu as well, so we got both. The Gooey Fries are one of the best things I've ever had in my life. White cheddar, chives, and salami?! My God. The only tiny thing is that the fries were grainy on the inside. But it honestly didn't matter, the toppings were so delicious. I ordered the Farm Burger that had duck bacon and a fried egg in top, it was glorious. The only suggestion I'd make here is that for me, a burger needs some kind of acid, and this had none, so I ended up dipping it in ketchup. But it was still amazing. My dining partner had the American Burger and loved it except that there were sweet pickles and that's just a big fat NOOOO in our world. But honestly, those are our personal tastes and this was an amazing experience. I only wish we could have finished our food, it's SO much!\\n\\nOur waitress Nadine was terrific, so friendly and pretty and helpful. The ambiance is spectacular with the giant fire wall. It's very loud, but most restaurants in Vegas are. But it was a blast and the highlight of our day. Kudos to Chef Ramsay and the people who run Burgr!!\",\n",

       " \"Saw a lot of positive reviews here on both Yelp and Trip Advisor, so my wife and I decided to see what the hype was all about. The farm house burger, cooked medium, was perfectly prepared and really delicious. The fried egg in the burger when broken thus spreading an added bit of goodness was a great touch. My wife had the UK burger, also cooked medium, was one of the best burgers she's had. The truffle fries were equally good, as well as their special ketchup blend and aioli sauce. The buffalo wings were excellent. Definitely not your typical bar fare buffalo wing. They also have a great and exceptional beer and wine list to accommodate your burger. Receptionist was friendly and waiter, Brandon, was awesome. Overall this is a great restaurant to try out when in Las Vegas and you're in the mood for a spectacular burger experience. All burgers are made with fresh ingredients and normally taken 20 minutes to prepare. Like i said, it's an experience. It is a pricy restaurant where the average burger is $16 and that is just the burger, but it's Vegas and it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.\",\n",

He pointed out Gordon Ramsey's favorite beer innis and gun. We both chose that. We ordered the jalapeño poppers and two burgers. I had the uber cheese burger and he had the Hell's Kitchen burger and we shared the truffle fries. The jalapeños were amazing. The best I've ever had. Super fresh and they came with cheddar ranch. One was supposed to come extra hot with seeds but we honestly couldn't tell which one. The burgers were cooked perfectly and taste like smokey goodness. It was so filling.

This restaurant is a great choice if you want to split those.\\nThey have a really fun tech menu for drinks.  Didn't get any but was cool to see that.  \\nI got the blue cheese burger, my girlfriend got a more standard american cheese, and we split the parmesan fries.  The blue was a bit gamey for my liking but was still very good.  Cooked to my requested medium nicely.  It would have been nice to see the fries more crispy, though, they were tasty.  The standard american cheeseburger was what really stood out.  There's something to be said for excellence in simplicity.  That burger had it.\\nIf i could do it again, I would get the standard cheeseburger and try one of their shakes.  \\nP.S.  If Burgr reads these, you should offer a tasting flight for your shakes.  Pick three minis for the price of one - or something along those lines.\",\n",
       " \"Four and a half stars, let's say, for the food- which was fantastic. Extra half star to bring it up to five for being the best service we got on the Strip during our long weekend.\\n\\nI ordered the farmhouse burger cooked rare, and it was perfect. I loved having the thick steak fries instead of the usual shoestring you get at other burger joints- we got the parmesan truffle.  \\n\\nA fantastic late-night dining experience overall.\",\n",
       " \"Great burgers, appetizers, and beer ....The service is great and everything comes in a reasonable amount of time. Strange there isn't a desert menu, hmmm. ..location is right in the thick of it on the strip....park over at the Bellagio for free for an hour, too.\",\n",

       " \"Maybe it was the jet lag, but I just didn't really enjoy my burger here.  I ordered the pork burger and it was just a dry salty patty with stuff on it.  It said it had pulled pork on top but it had less than a spoonful.\\n\\nI also had the gooey fries.  Meh is the best way to describe them.   The milk shake on the other hand was very good.  The custard milk shake combo was nice.  However for the price the milk shake was pretty small.\",\n",
       " \"Vegas ... ah Vegas. You are indeed a land of hyper sensitive seduction and debilitating travesty all wrapped up in a bedazzled jockstrap. \\n\\nThis is a story of conspiracy, longing, of askance glances, rushed introductions, missed opportunities, and figgy-onion jam. That damn jam.\\n\\nIt began in Planet Hollywood, where after a 6-hour drive from Cali, I'm exhausted, sunburned, and starving. \\n\\nThen BURGR's beatific signage loomed before me at that wondrous moment. I swear I hear angels chorusing (amongst BURGR's blazing ring of hellfire decor) Why, yes, I do want a hearty, meaty, juicy meal. Why yes, I want this meal done good. Why yes, a Gordon Ramsey establishment satisfies that level of cooking skills of awesome nommy-ness that my belly needs. \\n\\nBut that serendipitous moment did not transcend. Nay. I was denied by the majority (broke people). And then thus ushered to the nearby buffet, where I consoled myself in steamed mussels in what is called Le booby prize. Resentment brewed in my gut as well as indigestion. Why do we always succumb to this buffet tradition? Why do we fear this volatile, plate throwing, angry chef man? \\n\\nBut my tirade was abruptly aborted, when I went into what as known as a food stupor. This is not exactly aligned with the condition known as food coma. Food coma usually attacks as you are awake or attempting a movement like sitting. Food stupor made me forget what I was going to say and just mindlessly gnawed on a chicken bone.\\n\\nLater, at 3am I was stirred out of bed with the screech of alarms and a rush of water flooding the hallway of our 32nd floor. Realizing this was not the steamed mussels talking, I got up. Someone tampered with the sprinklers. Our hallway turned into a moat in 20 minutes. That was just as long as it took to get security up there, banging on our doors to shoo us down to the lobby. So somewhere between being denied a dine-in at BURGR and a faulty sprinkler, I'm trekking my ass through a swamp of dirty carpet, and left to camp out in PH's lobby in my pajamas. Bad tan, indigestion, insomnia and all.\\n\\nAt 530am, I've been awake for 20 straight hours. I'm suffering through the sensations of grumbling steamed mussels, whiny drunks, and gnarly-looking divas, and as if to mock me for a lifetime of bad decisions: BURGR's signage is still looming over the lobby. Will it never end? So I was wrong to deny you! Cut me some slack! But nothing. Vegas why you wrong me so?! Can I blow $100 on some black jack and we call it a truce? \\n\\nWhen we finally were relocated to a suite after the moat disaster, we were granted something I would've never foretold in this whole debacle: \\n\\nA $150 voucher to BURGR. \\n\\nOh yeah. So I told myself, I can just sleep 3 hours and head out into the 108 degree heat. I can hang until BURGR opens and line up for 2 hours. Two hours, dude, with two kids. The wait had better be worth it. \\n\\nI speak of askance glances because the man who sat us at the table was too good looking for his own good. Was he a long lost Gosling or something? Rushed intros because after waiting for 2 hours, we didn't even hear our server speaking over our drooling and gnashing of teeth. Missed opportunities because I went with the chanterelle burger and its confusing onion figgy jam. \\n\\nThe patty was juicy, cooked just right. But I have to admit it: the meat was barely warm edging to cold. I think the figgy-onion jam had something to do with that, because that jam was cold too in a way that it was previously chilled and turning warm after absorbing the meat's heat. The chanterelle mushrooms on top of this jam, I couldn't distinguish their flavour. It was overall sweet with some wisp of umami taste.  But the sweet flavour still had a bland taste. I really wanted some salt. None of the flavours sang to me. The angels had been silenced. \\n\\nThus, my regret. I've always been a cheeseburger girl, I dunno what I was thinking. But I put on my best happy face, as I didn't want to be That Chick at the table, pissing on everyone else's fun cuz my burger was kinda sweet and cold (sounds like something an ex would call me).\\n\\nMissed opportunity, my friends. I had longed for a chance to dine at a place like this. While everyone else seemed to fall madly in love their burgers, I was silently underwhelmed. The truffle fries are good, sweet potato fries dare I say better. It would've been a perfect meal if I had just gotten the right burger for me. \\n\\nI would pass on that jam next time. Get the one with the cheese and the egg, and top it off with a shake. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me.\",\n",

We were there for Nascar weekend and also my daughters 21st birthday. I put our table in at 8 adults and TWO children, we waited about 40 minutes. They put us at a high bar stool table that only fit 8, so I told them I said two children as well and they re-seated us within a reasonable time of about 5 minutes with a perfect table. I asked the server if they do anything for birthdays, just something simple to acknowledge why we were there as my daughter loved the place and she said yes they would bring her a push pop dessert. The food was excellent! We got the gooey fries (TO DIE FOR) and 2 orders of onion rings as appetizers, it was perfect, all ate up nothing left over no problem. Everyone loved their burgers and my daughter, husband and myself all got the crisp fish sandwiches, so good, the malt vinegar chips are the perfect touch. When the check came for over 250.00 I was happy with that, but the server had forgotten to acknowledge the birthday, it really was not that big of a deal to me, but we had two kids there, one who is a toddler and at that stage, she doesn't believe a birthday happens without a candle and fire and a cake! All in all, we will be back, but the service could have been better having to wait for a second table and not remembering the birthday.\",\n",
       " \"This place was pretty good but its not the best burger i have had in Vegas. The jalepeno poppers were delicious! We had the Hell's Kitchen burger, Euro burger and truffle fries. The truffle fries seemed to be plain with just a little shaved parm on top but the white dip that came with it was so good i was putting it on my burger. Overall experience I dont think you would be missing out on to much if you skipped this spot and you would save $60\",\n",
       " \"Excellent burgers :] lines are ridiculous, but it's worth the wait. I wish they had more dessert options :b the shake is yummy, but I wasn't fan of the top half (the pudding part). Overall, it was worth the hype and everyone should try it at least once.\",\n",
       " \"All I can say is Aaaaamazing! Their long wait in line was worth it! The pace of the line was quick about 15-20 minute which was better than 30 or 45. They do their best to accommodate and make sure everyone is fed in fast manner. Their server is mostly men but their hostess are female which is pretty different. I love this place and wanted to order a to go because their burger was that good!!!\\n\\nIf you are searching for a tasty burger that is well seasoned and sauces that just tingle your mouth, this is a place to try! If you are on the saving side, probably wouldn't recommend it. Their burger prices range from 13-15 dollars and this is just for an average size burger without any sides. Their sides such as fries is an additional cost, so you'd be coughing out about 40-50 dollars depending how much you order and what items. But since I enjoy watching his shows, I wanted to give it shot and was not disappointed.\",\n",

Many different choices but simple enough not to get too weird either. I had the Gordon Ramsey burger, which you have to ask for, but had it with a beef patty instead of the pork. Medium is perfect for myself, but they'll cook it anyway you like short of raw...Great, but not mind blowing flavor, very well put together and the duck bacon is an interesting touch. I still think I make a better burger at home :-)  I had the onion rings, as well and they could have been a bit crunchier. The whiskey lemonade was strong and cold but $15 a shot so be ready to pay if you're drinking too.  A good place for a solid burger, but expect to pay for it with Gordon's name attached to the place. I'd definitely go back and probably will. Def good eats there!\",\n",

       " \"Eh. The decor was amazing. The food was ok. The milkshakes are amazing!!! The service was not good. Which is ironic considering who Gordon Ramsey is. I'm for certain he would fire the two female bartenders that were there on Wednesday. No professionalism at all. Lazy. The Black guy that was at the bar that day was picking up all of their slack and most of us weren't even his customers.\",\n",

The first was The London in West Hollywood, which was an amazing experience. \\n\\nI got the chanterelle burger and we split truffle fries. The burger was delicious but nothing special. The mushrooms were a bit too subtle and the figgy-onion jam was a bit too sweet. The whole thing was surprisingly very forgettable.\\n\\nThe fries on the other hand were spectacular. Thick cut, perfectly salted, and generously covered in Parmesan cheese. It came with two different dips. One was a truffle aioli. I don't even remember what the second one was, but the truffle aioli was like crack. My brother and I fought over the fries like vultures and they were nearly all gone before we even touched the burgers. We then took the remaining truffle dip and spread it over our burgers as well. Seriously amazing. Next time if I'm ever in Vegas I'd probably just order multiple orders of fries and eat them until I feel sick.\\n\\nOh yeah, the figgy pudding push ups were great as well!\",\n",

The meat was perfectly seasoned, which I can totally appreciate, and the buns were neither too hard nor too soft (i.e., soggy) - it was just right!\\n\\nThey also have Boddington's on tap.

Duck bacon, Anaheim peppers, curry, and chipotle ketchup are some of the unique items here. In addition to excellent burgers the fries were top-notch.

So I went with the Farm burger and my husband opted the Hell's Kitchen burger. They were just right . And for the appetizers we ordered the hot pork pockets & onion rings.

I'm a HUGE burger person & Gordon Ramsay's biggest fan.. seriously.\\n\\nUpon arriving you will most likely see the longest line ever right along the fiery walls of BurGR. (It's only for parties of 2 so it worked out my 1st visit there). Being in Planet Hollywood & a Gordon Ramsay F&B chain, I wasn't surprised. The place itself is surprisingly small. Probably because it only got a small space near the busy foot traffic exit/entrance of the hotel. It's actually not bad if you're with 1 other person & can wait in the line, but my group of 10 was split between 2 tables in the end & we waited almost 5 hours before I got a text  saying our tables were ready (They DO NOT take RESERVATIONS). And our 2 groups of 5 never saw each other throughout the entire meal. I'm pretty sure it was a slower day. But thanks staff, for the attentive & great service from beginning to the end :) Waiter recommendations were also spot on & helpful.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\n  I ordered the HONEY-PIG BAO BUNS b/c they looked delicious on the menu. It was $13. For TWO (2) Bao Buns. The pork was probably not imported or magical I assume. Each finish-able in 2 bites each & just slapped together really quick. Such a disappointment when it only tasted okay & I could make a better one at home.\\n  HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER. The meat was cooked & seasoned well, but again the size/portion was a little disappointing. Also, I wish the burger had more contrast in texture. Great flavors.. but roasted jalapeno & tomato, cheese avocado are all mushy ingredients.. Saved by the brioche bread though. Yum.\\n  I also got the DAMNATION CHICKEN BURGER. (Thanks BurGR for letting me take out the blue cheese!) It was okay. Probably better if you like blue cheese & didn't omit it. But the chicken burger was juicy & I totally understood the flavor concept. I ordered this when I went with the group & I wasn't too hungry.\\n  My friend ordered the FARM BURGER. How can you say no to bacon?! Especially if it's duck breast bacon! And who can say no to a fried egg?! It was great & I know one of the most popular menu items.\\n  Also got a side of TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES. They were deeeelicious & a good portion :) Love the truffle aioli too.\\n  Lastly, GET A SHAKE. Shake #4 CREME BRULEE PUDDING OREO SHAKE... It's amazing. The shakes are all crazy delicious flavors & ingredients creating 5 unique shakes. SO WORTH IT.\\n\\n\\nMy final opinion? If I lived near Vegas, I'd definitely go & try every burger if I could.\\nBurgers are my favorite food & this place pioneers innovative & creative flavor concepts/ideas. Beyond the waiting in line it's pretty great. I gave 4 STARS because of the OVERPRICED appetizer & the QUALITY of the dishes didn't reach my standard. I know they're busy & they need to keep tickets going but..

We stumble across the restaurant in Planet Hollywood and thought with Ramsay reputation at least the food should be amazing. \\n\\nTERRIBLE SERVICE:   When we first arrived they take you number and text you a wait time, kind of nice, except it was 30 minutes off.  After waiting 30 minutes longer than they estimated our buzzer goes off to get seated they say, but really it was to wait in another line of people whose buzzers have gone off.  In this line they pulled parties that came after us, to go ahead of us.  Then we are finally seated over an hour later.  To wait another 10 minutes to even see a waiter, who then does not bring us the water we ordered.  It took another 15 minutes to get our water from a bus boy.  It was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had.  \\n\\nSUB PAR FOOD: At least the food we ordered should be good, NOT.  The food was ok at best.  My boyfriend didn\\'t even finish half of his Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger it was so bad and my Farmer\\'s Burger was only decent.  They also charge $8 just for regular fries on the side!!!\\n\\nI read other reviews with the same complaints so DON\"T BE FOOLED.

They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position. \\n\\nBut let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was. \\n\\nI cannot wait to return here!',\n",

I prefer my fries a little more crispier on the outside. \\n\\nThe jalepeno poppers were interesting, but I think I like the presentation more than the taste.

It's OK, and since this resto is competing with the best of the best in Vegas, my take on ambience was jus meh ..\\nShakes - 4.5/5 - Yum\\nService - 2/5 - Very average service for those prices; service is just like any damn gastropub where you'd get a burger for ~$9. Come on guys, you are promoting yourselves as a top notch burger joint and you've gotta do better than that on service.\\n\\nFactors of annoyance - Huge (I mean insane) Wait Times .. I can understand the line outside, but taking over 50 mins for 1 chicken burger and 1 fish sandwich is WAY too much, I don't care how busy your resto is.. In sum, not at all pleased with this place, can't see myslef going back here especially when there are options galore in Vegas ...\",\n",
       " 'After an unpleasant experience with the food last time I came I decided to give this place another chance while I was in Vegas. \\nInstead of ordering a chicken burger this time I just order a regular American burger to try and my mom gets ballsy and orders the spicy Hell\\'s Kitchen burger. We also started off with onion rings. \\nI absolutely loved my burger. It was delicious. It completely made up for the bad burger I had here when I came the first time. My mom however, although was warned, sent her burger back because it was too spicy. She reordered the same one as me instead because she saw how much I enjoyed it. \\nThe weird thing was when they brought back the new burger it was cut in half. She asked why it was cut in half and they said they needed to ensure the temperature of the burger. I thought that was a pretty stupid answer since they\\'re not doing that for all their burgers so clearly there\\'s another method to check the \"temperature\". She was pretty upset they cut it because it made eating the sandwich harder since everything kept falling apart and it became super messy which ruined her experience. \\nAnyway, besides that downside, I had a good time and the waiter was nice and attentive.',\n",
       " \"This place deserves every ounce of hype it gets. Talk about redefining the burger. If you wish to confirm why this place always has lines that rival those of the best nightclub at Cosmopolitan, pay a visit after midnight, when the hordes are getting wasted elsewhere. You will find that even the humble AMERICAN BURGER here is vastly superior to anything you have tasted at the mainstream burger joints. My personal favorite is the HELL KITCHEN'S BURGER, but I warn you about its spiciness. It's hot. It's sexy. Your first bite of it will result in an orgasmic burst of traditional Mexican flavors fused with all the protein greatness of well-prepared American meat. Skip the sweet potato fries. Their water tastes like wonderful chlorine, so splurge on beer or if you are desperate, soda. On the weekends, get a booth and avoid the bar at all costs. The gal there is super nice, but the guy bartenders are as pleasant as an emphysemic smoker's overly ripe phloem!\",\n",

       " \"As I mentioned in a previous review, I am a burger & fry fiend. I know my burgers, whether they're beef or chicken.  I've had shite burgers at 5-star places & fantastic burgers at highway dumps. I love Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, and not because it's Gordon's restaurant. \\n\\nInside Planet Hollywood where the poker room once was, next to the Extra Lounge, you can enter from Las Vegas Blvd. on foot or walk through the Miracle Mile Shops & casino to get there. \\n\\nI'm a Vegas local & am fortunate enough to come here whenever I want.  I've been here 4-5 times in the last 5 months or so.  To date I've tried the American, Uber, Farm, the Hog, Damnation Chicken, & Southern Yard burgers; standard dawg; truffle & original fries; and onion rings.\\n\\nDamnation & Southern Yard burgers are both ground chicken burgers.  The flavour is the same for each, it's the toppings that set them apart.  The Damnation comes with a spicy mayo, blue cheese, carrot & celery slaw; the Southern Yard has BBQ sauce, butter lettuce, sharp cheddar, and butter pickles. Honestly, as good as each is, I didn't care for either.  It is a juicy burger, not dry at all; however, as flavourful as it is I wasn't keen on the seasoning.  I'm sensitive to spicy food & did not find the mayo on the Damnation to be spicy at all; the blue cheese seemed to overpower the entire burger.  I'm not a fan of butter pickles so off they came from the Southern Yard.  The BBQ sauce is light, definitely homemade & the cheese was nice.  Again, I just didn't care for the burger seasoning.  Certainly try it as it may be more to your liking than mine.  \\n\\nAll beef burgers I tried were medium well & just great. The burger was moist & did not drip of grease, which is a nice change. The Farm burger has duck bacon which I didn't care for but the fried egg was a nice touch. I've not had duck before & I found the bacon to be too gamey, so I pulled it off.  The Uber is just a cheesey cheeseburger: 3 types of cheese & beef...I loved it.  As for the American...it is the traditional cheeseburger & I never knew plain & simple could be so good.\\n\\nThe standard dawg is a traditional beef swag with mustard, catsup, onions, & butter pickles.  It is a mildly spicy dawg & did not leave me needing Tums after. Nicely toasted poppy seed bun.  Beware...the dawg itself is longer than the bun.  I needed a knife & fork to tackle this. If you're a hot dawg fan not looking for anything complicated then try this. \\n\\nFries & onion rings are great. It's the various sauces served with each that bring out the best in these classic sides. Refer to the menu for what is served with each. My fave is the chipotle catsup. \\n\\nLastly, the Hog.  Pulled pork this is not. It seemed dry & not too flavourful.  It is very popular however, just not my thing.\\n\\nOf note: each of my visits had me seated in front of the kitchen. If you can sit here I highly recommend it. I enjoyed seeing all the different dishes come out. I NEVER saw anything come back. \\n\\nThe drink & dessert menu is displayed on an iPad.  Not sure this is necessary, but it's neat.  Lots of imports on tap, nice British selection.\\n\\nNow, the line...this place stays busy because it's really good.  Why people complain about the line is beyond me. A LINE IS A GOOD THING. Groups take longer to seat, up to an hour; 1-2 persons takes 15-30 minutes.  Groups of 12 or more CAN make a reservation by calling Planet Hollywood.\",\n",

The sauce was incredible and not as spicy as I had feared, the meat tender, and the portion size just right. Next, the Brittania burger I ordered was absolutely delicious. I loved the sweet nuance the mango chutney added, and the burger patty was cooked medium rare just as I had asked them to. \\n\\nOur service the first time around was great, too. Our hostess and our waitress were both very friendly and welcoming, and our waitress did not hesitate to explain the difference between the burgers to us. \\n\\nUnfortunately, my second time here was not as lovely. I ordered the Chanterelle burger, which came out nicely. The issue is that we had to wait for our food for thirty minutes and it was difficult to flag down our server, even though he was constantly walking around our area. He just didn't seem to notice. In the end, our burgers came out at the same time as our appetizer, which I thought was a little bit of a bummer. The food was great. The service not so much.

My expectations were only growing by the minute. \\n\\nThe interior was stunning - nice seating arrangement and unique decor. We first ordered our drinks and some fries to start us off. Surprisingly, the fries were nearly soggy. They weren't even cooked to where it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just plain mushy. Nonetheless, I didn't really fuss about it, and kept on eating. Then our entrees came out; I ordered a pasta and he ordered a burger. Based upon the description of my pasta, I was expecting flavorful goooodness - but I didn't. Pasta was lacking more sauce (although even if they did add more sauce, there'd be no difference because the sauce was flavorless and quiet unappetizing). I only wish I remembered what pasta is was. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, although commented that he's had better in the past. \\n\\nAll-in-all, the aura of the environment was pleasant, service was kind, and I had a lovely date; I just wish my food was as great.

We began with an order of onion rings as an appetizer.  It was likely the best we have ever eaten. We did not care for the special chipotle ketsup so we asked for regular. Next we split the Farm Burger and fries. The burger was delicious. The egg bun was excellent with two types of sesame seeds. The burger was cooked perfectly and included a duck bacon and fried egg. We then realized that the busboy had removed our previously requested ketsup. We asked for more but while we waited the burger and fries started to get cold. Timing was off and it ruined the experience of the meal. The waitress deducted the fries but in the end, the meal just wasn't enjoyed.

They were exactly as named... gooey with goodness!\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and I ordered the Euro burger. Not gonna lie, I liked mine more! His was good and hit you with some good basic flavors of a traditional burger but had an added kick with the jalapeño in it. Mine was covered in flavor (more than his in my opinion). The goat cheese is an awesome flavor addition. Nice and fresh ingredients in everything.\\n\\nThe staff was also super sweet and friendly. Even had the manager come out and greet everyone which was a nice touch. \\n\\nOur total bill was around $60-65 I believe, but we definitely got our money's worth. I'd absolutely return and recommend it. It's all totally worth it!\",\n",
       " \"As expected the burgers were fantastic! One of the best i've had. We tried the chanterelle burger and the hell's kitchen. Very different but both equally great. Even though we got medium well, the burgers were still very soft and juicy. The truffle fries were huge. I presonally prefer thinner cut fries and these were more english style thick potato chips but still pretty tasty. \\n\\nFood: 5/5\\nService and atmosphere: 4/5\\nPrice: 4.5/5 (considering it is in Vegas and but GR, the price is pretty reasonable) \\nOverall: 4.5/5\",\n",

Waited 35 minutes. .. But whatever.... You got the miracle mile shops to pass the time.

I asked for suggestions and they really good about asking what I liked in a burger. I went with their European Burger, that had goat cheese and other strong tasty cheeses and it was GREAT. Small but mighty burger. Also ordered some fries to share and it was worth it. \\nThe meal was not big in quantity, but it made it up for the quality. I will be back to try different burgers in the future.',\n",

The flavors are unique and the seasoning helps you remember why Gordon is so good at what he does. I love this place!\\n\\nThe one star that is missing is for the poor service from our waitress.

Having eaten at his pub and grill before and having a great experience I didn't think BurGR was going to be the way it ended up. The wait was 2 hours to get a table and once inside it took forever to even get our order taken. The jalapeño poppers we stared out with were terrible and I've had better at. sonic. The inside was still cold. Unfortunately cold food seemed to be the theme of the night. Our fries and onion rings were brought out cold. My burger was cold and flavorless while the hot dog I had was just ridiculously too big for the bun it was on. Our server and many inexcusable reasons why he didn't get our food to us sooner. When you first walk into this place they have flames shooting all over so where the heck was the hot food and flavor? I really hoped for a better burger at this place.\",\n",
       " \"It was okay. Nothing extraordinary. The meat was cooked perfectly, but the overall flavor of the burger wasn't anything memorable. The fries were hard and not very good. The jalapeno peppers were good. Honestly, I'd rather have eaten at Red Robin. They also serve Pepsi and not Coke products. I know that's not a big deal to some, but to me the quality of the drinks is important when enjoying my meal. The chairs are also really uncomfortably low to the ground. Every time I would see the server seat someone you could tell they couldn't get comfortable because of how low the chairs are. \\n\\nOur waiter was nice and very knowledgable.\",\n",

My co-wokers had the Hell's Kitchen burgers and they said they really liked it them.  I really liked the truffle parmesan fries and I highly recommend that you get them. YUMMY!  We also had the jalapeno poppers, we all loved them.  We all like spicy food so none of us knew if we got the japapeno with the seeds because we are use to spice.  I also recommend trying these the dipping sauce for them is really good.  The last thing we ordered was the sticky toffee pudding pops.  I'm not a big desert person but after reading everyone's reviews on them we had to try them.  They were DE-LISH!  I thought the service was great but I really wish they would take reservations.  Our wait was 45 minutes so it wasn't to bad.  I really recommend coming here because its a great atmosphere, food is great, and good service.\",\n",

We had a really awesome waitress named Clark too! She really took her time to talk to us and was very helpful! The busser was super nice as well! Sorry I don't know your name, but he was a cute 26 year old red head ;D you know who you are if you're reading this! Lol! \\n\\nSo the very first thing I ordered was a shake! I got my own mixture: the creme brûlée pudding topping with a strawberry bottom! No regrets!!! Loved it! Worth it! You can't get a shake like this at Starbucks and you'll probably pay just as much if you buy it in the casino! Get a shake! You need it :D\\n\\nWe tried the onion rings, the truffle butter fries, and jalapeño poppers tonight! OMG the TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES... AMAZING! The truffle aioli is so amazing that I dipped my burger in it! Everything here should have truffle aioli on it! You should also get the jalapeño poppers too; love that they put it in individual shot glasses! \\n\\nFor my burger I got the Farmers Burger! It's good, but I think I loved my appetizers better honestly! The meat was so tender though! Just wish it was a little juicer! \\n\\nOverall I'm happy! Presentation was beautiful and service was world class! I definitely will be coming again!\",\n",
       " \"The best part of BurGR is the fire display at the door, because it's all downhill from there on in. The waiter came up trying to sell us on cocktails, when we just wanted waters, that was the end of customer service. 15 minutes later my bf ordered a Coke so we can finally get 2 glasses of water, while tables that were seated after us got their paid drinks in no time. Then there's the food, which took about 45 minutes. Since when did chef Ramsy's kitchen tolerate this type of service? The restaurant was full but very few tables had food, a lot of folks had folded arms and a hangry look, while 4 waiters were standing around together chatting! I finally got fed up and told our waiter to check on our order, it's been half an hour. His response was that's normal, usually takes the kitchen 20-25 minutes. EXCUSE ME?! First of all, don't be defending slow service to an already upset customer, secondly, 20-25 minutes has come and gone! When the food finally showed up 45 mins later, it was not bad but not spectacular, definitely not worth my time. The onion rings and blue burger were drenched in too much salt. No tip and never coming back!\",\n",
       " 'Great dining experience. Expect to wait in line though. Sat at the bar so could see the kitchen at work. Great farm burger and sweet potato fries.  Nice and passionate staff.',\n",
       " 'GO BURGER OFF!!!\\n\\nThat seems like something Chef Ramsey would say! Unfortunately I will never know because Gordon was not here tonight. \\n\\nWhen I walked in, the bar was completely packed and about half the tables were full. I then saw there was a counter by the pass to eat at.  I asked to sit there and they said yes! Why wouldn\\'t anyone want to eat there. You can see all of the food being made. The chef calling out orders. Yes there is some action but nothing like you would see on FOX! I did hear one F word by the sous chef but it was harmless. I needed more.  This is Vegas give me a show. \\n\\nI was trying to take it all in.  The waitress asked if I wanted a drink. I think she was hoping I would say, \"Coors Light!\" But I had to be difficult and ask her what kind of beers they had. She ran off to grab me a list. They had so many they were all listed on an iPad for me to scroll through. I did like looking at the photos of the specialty drinks. The pictures do make it easy to order.\\n\\nI decided to order the Roasted jalapeño poppers to start with. They were stuffed with cheddar bacon and had a dipping sauce of cheddar ranch. One of the gimmicks was that only one jalapeno had a fiery surprise. Since I was eating all 6, I knew one was coming my way. It happened to be my 2nd jalapeño.  I like hot and it was really good. The sad part is that the others did not stand up, after that. The manager Scott happened to come by and see how I was doing.  I suggested that the restaurant have an option for all 6 to be fiery. He liked that idea. So hopefully he will tell it to Gordon but I\\'m not holding my breath. I\\'m sure Gordon has bigger things to worry about. \\n\\nWe did have an issue but the waitress jumped on it with the sous chef. I told her I wanted to enjoy my poppers first and I wanted my burger after I was done with them. She told me not a problem that it would take 20 minutes.  A few minutes later she realized I was the only ticket on the board and she told the chef to push back my burger. The cook did not look happy.  I diverted my eyes, so I wouldn\\'t get in trouble. So much for me wanting some action here. I was getting a little scared.  I\\'m so glad the waitress looked at the ticket board while we were talking. I would have been not happy. \\n\\nI decided to order the Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger which had oven roasted tomatoes, roasted jalepeno, avacado & asadero cheese! I also ordered it medium rare.  I asked the waitress to have no extra salt added to my burger when it hit the grill. She told me that they would never do that. I had to disagree with her. She called over the sous chef who then informed the waitress they do hit the burger on the grill with salt, pepper and garlic. I am so glad I was sitting at the pass or my order might have been screwed up so bad. The waitress then asked the chef, \"How do I even write that up?\" He looked at her and said, \"Check no seasoning on the ticket!\"\\n\\nI had to wait a lot longer for my burger then expected.  I almost thought that they forgot about me. I looked at the tickets and there were a bunch up there. So I was hoping I just got pushed back. It did give me a little time to do some social postings for BurGR. When I go out to eat it is starting to feel like a job, but I\\'m glad to share these amazing food experiences with others. \\n\\nThe best part about sitting at the pass was that my burger was delivered by the sous chef. I also saw him wipe off a spot of blood from my white plate. Somewhere Gordon is smiling. It was also a good feeling to know that my burger did not linger up at the pass waiting for the waitress to pick it up. \\n\\nI must say that the burger was really good. Everything worked together.  I loved how the tomatoes and jalapenos were roasted. The fresh avacado was a nice touch. I also liked the asadero cheese which I had never had before. The bun was fantastic too. I also learned that they are baked on site. You can tell because how fresh they are. I also taste some butter in there. \\n\\nChef Ramsey you put together one tasty burger. I\\'m so glad I don\\'t live in Vegas because my fellow Yelpers know I don\\'t need another burger joint to obsesses over plus I don\\'t think they can handle all of the delicious photos. \\n\\nSo when you come to Vegas, BurGR is a must visit. Thanks to the Aria and the Cosmopolitan because this area of the strip is the hot place to hang. BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood. Fastest way there is from the street. Do not go into the shops! Head into Casino door and it is right there by the front! Another tip is to have your Rewards Card with you too because you will save about a dollar per item. I saved $2...winning! Hey it\\'s Vegas. I\\'m totally ahead now! Thanks Gordon!',\n",
       " \"Decided to give this place a try after seeing Carrot Top (Hilarious) at the Luxor. I have seen a lot of Gordon Ramsey's shows on TV so my wife and I had very high expectations for this place.\\n\\nWell I must say that BurGR did not disappoint. I ordered the Farm Burger done Medium and it was delicious. Very juicy and lots of flavor. My wife ordered the American done Medium Well since she doesn't like to venture out and try new things and she said it was the best burger she has had. We also had the Parmesan Fries and they were very good. They were not salty like most Parmesan Fries and the sauces that came with it were very good. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and explained the menu. Refills were brought to us without being asked which is a big plus. So if you're ever in Vegas and are looking for a spot where you can enjoy a good burger and atmosphere, this is the place. Oh and by the way my wife and I were sober when we went here.\\n\\nAlmost forgot that we ordered the push pops for desert and they were also delicious. Not too sweet or salty and just enough to keep your taste buds guessing and wanting more.\",\n",
       " \"Yelp didn't go wrong with this one!  We were in the area and did a yelp search for a good restaurant, and voila.  We had been watching the fountains at Bellagio and wanted somewhere nearby.\\n\\nAnyway, we found the restaurant, and then saw the line to get a seat and almost left (it was Friday night).  But the guy in front of us in line overheard us and told us not to leave, the wait was worth it.  He comes at least every year.  So alas we waited.  So glad we did!  It didn't end up taking too long anyway.  \\n\\nI asked the waiter what was good, so we ordered his top two recommendations.  I got the Farm burger and my husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger, and we got the truffle parmesan fries.  It did take a while for the food to come, so we ordered a beer each.  They have a good variety of beers on tap.  \\n\\nWhen the food came out, I was in love.  My hubby and I split our burgers (such a good man), so we could try both of them.  I loved every bite of each!  The farm burger had bacon (duck breast bacon, apparently- although I wouldn't know the difference, it was good), cheddar, and a fried egg.  I ordered it medium, and it was perfect, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The hell's kitchen burger had a number of spicy things on it (jalapenos, spicy cheese, etc), so I was a little nervous after reading the description that it would be too spicy to enjoy, but it was just right.  It had a good bite without being to spicy that your taste buds went numb.  And I was leery about getting the truffle parmesan fries, I adamantly do not like mushrooms but I'm trying to expand my palate, and the waiter said people love them.  So glad we listened, they were excellent!  The sauces that came with them were pretty good too.  I forget what they were, something along the aioli lines and something a bit spicy-ketchuppy. \\n\\nWhen in Vegas, WE WILL BE BACK!  Fantastic experience.\",\n",
       " \"This was the best birthday meal! BurGR is the perfect meeting of typical American food with some posh flavors and styling. I had the Yardbird which was sweet but also spicy so that it wasn't overwhelming. My boyfriend had the American burger and that felt like it got everything right about the burger. We also got truffle fries that paired really well with the dipping sauces. We could barely finish it between the both of us, but we did not regret it. We finished off our meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pops. They were so cute when they came on the stand. They were so sweet and alternated between the pudding and sponge cake type layer. \\n\\nThe customer service was great too. The girl who took our order was kind and attentive. And when she took a little bit longer than usual, she made sure to apologize even though she didn't need to!\\n\\nMy only complaint is that a soda costed 4 dollars. A soda should not cost that much. But I'll let that slide because it was so good.\",\n",
       " 'Except for the fact that the burger takes 20+ minutes to arrive, this is a solid spot on the strip for a recovery meal. $7 pints with a good selection (get the White IPA). \\n\\nAlso get the Ramsay Burger, not on the menu. Duck fat bacon, avocado, onion and roasted red peppers I think? Whatever, it was delicious.',\n",
       " 'They got rid of the standing up knives. \\nThe burgers were not the same. We got the Hell\\'s Kitchen burger again and this time it was flavorless. We also got the earth burger and it was very very sweet. Wasn\\'t expecting it to be that sweet. \\nThe shakes are good but the \"pudding\" at the top has no flavor and tastes like solid thick whipped cream with gelatin. \\nThe honey pig bao buns are not good. Piece of fat with carrots and cilantro on a stale Chinese bun. Plus it is very sweet as well. \\n\\nHope the next time we come it will be better.',\n",

The experience and food at BurGR were absolutely worth the visit. Our server was extremely helpful with picking a burger that satisfied our pallets and a perfect cold beer to wash it down. \\n\\nWe started off the meal with some of the Jalapeño Poppers and of course they were delicious. The creaminess of the ranch sauce complimented the spiciness of the peppers quite well.  The burger was cooked (ordered a medium rare) and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered fries and they were fried and seasoned perfectly. I always find myself adding more salt to my fries, but not here!\\n\\nThe difference in the quality of ingredients compared to your \"regular\" gourmet burger joint is night and day. Granted, BurGR is a tad bit more pricier than those said joints, but the service and food is unrivaled. We will definitely be returning here next time we visit Vegas!',\n",

We settled on the Hog Burger, the Euro Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and an Innis and Gunn beer (apparently, Gordon Ramsey's favorite).\\n\\nThe burgers were large, super juicy, but didn't fall apart when you cut into it! I'm not into eating huge burgers with my hands (as it gets all over the place and my face), and was happy I could eat it with a knife and fork. The Hog Burger comes with a pork patty, and has a hearty juicy ham flavor. The Euro Burger has a good spread of truffle aioli, which never disappoints.\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were really interesting as it was paired with a honey jalapeno mayo, a flavor I've never tasted before, but delicious!\\n\\nWe concluded that we are definitely returning. I hope we get the same server again!\",\n",

Even if you are far away, I think this place is worth a side trip! \\n\\nEven if you don't eat meat, you can indulge here. We had non-meat eaters in our group who had the Earth Burger (portobello mushroom, fontina, veggies) and the Fish & Crisp Sandwich (this thing was ENORMOUS). Both were very happy with their food! On the carnivore side, the Euro Burger was absolutely amazing...truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and roasted tomato. The burger was cooked to perfection (medium rare). Sooooooo flavorful and totally exceeded my expectations. The truffle fries were also fantastic and came with truffle aioli and curry ketchup for dipping. YUM! Burgers range from $13-$16 and the fries were $11 ($8 for plain fries). It is pricey, but totally worth it and you can split the food without any sharing charge. The beer menu was also very impressive featuring many craft beers of all styles. \\n\\nThe waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. We had a few waiters visit our table and they were constantly filling waters and asking if we needed anything. One of our partygoers had a birthday and the staff didn't hesitate to bring a birthday dessert while singing Happy Birthday.

The roasted tomatoes really add a great depth of flavor too. \\n\\nService was great, attentive, never had to ask for water or a refill, and I felt well taken care of. They also provide an iphone to fill out a survey on the service, so this might give added incentive for the staff to be on the ball. \\nIts in my top 10 for burgers.\\n4.5/5 stars\",\n",

We waiting in line for about 15 min and were offered a seat at the bar at which point we were too hungry to say no!  The bartender was friendly and chatty.  Before we even looked at the menu, he recommended 2 burgers for me and my friend.   I had the Farm Burger and we split a side of sweet potato fries and each ordered a cocktail. My burger was pretty affordable at $15 with duck breast bacon, cheddar and topped with a fried egg.  What I loved about the sweet potato fries is that it was sprinkled with icing sugar!  I could not let such good fries go to waste so I finished them up even after my partner gave up.  I ordered a green tea gin cocktail which was served in a stemless martini glass...a bit strong but good.  It was a really satisfying meal for a very reasonable Vegas price!',\n",

Although it was a bit pricey for burgers, it was totally worth it! especially to experience a place where Hell's Kitchen was filmed!\\n\\nIt was a wonderful experience and fun ambience in the a prime location on the Strip.  Definitely a go-to casual place in Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"First off, we came with a party of 11 people ranging from ages 15-25. Mostly people in their 20s. We called earlier asking to make a reservation but they told us they don't take reservations. When we got there we were able to immediately go to the front of the line and quickly tell the hostess. We were then told that the tables would be ready in about an hour and they were. \\n\\nPRICE- averages about $15 to $18 per burger. Fries are about $10 along with dessert. Quite pricey but not overly expensive for a famous chef's restaurant. Definitely not a place I would repeatedly go to. \\n\\nFOOD- I really liked the food. I ordered the truffle fries and the euro burger. For dessert I had the toffee pops. However I can't say it was the best because i was given a medium burger rather than medium rare. As a chef who emphasizes such things on TV, I was highly disappointed. ALSO 3 of my other family members received an overcooked and dry burger. Despite that I just continued to eat it seeing as how we were starving and in a rush. The vegetables and seasoning was perfect on the burger but like I said, mine was a bit dry. The truffle Parmesan fries are enough for two people. They were quite delicious with the sauces they came with! The toffee pops were good as well! It's just the flavor scan be a bit overwhelming by themselves. Get them Togo! The design on those were genius, seeing how they prevented messiness. They were pretty sweet with a saltiness to them. It reminded me of drum stick ice cream consistency. The cake layers were delicious. I just wished they made it so that there was a cake core with the toffee pudding surrounding it. That way you could get the taste of both of them together. \\n\\nSERVICE-OUR WAITRESS WAS HORRIBLE. She was polite enough when we came. She got our orders down. After probably a 40 minute wait, she comes to tell us our food will be out in about 5 minutes. Come 15 minutes later, our food is out. This was expected seeing as how our party was quite large. Now I must say, we only saw her twice throughout the whole 2 hours we were there. NOT once did she check up on us again and NOT once did she refill our drinks or bring any food out. Now I know this lady existed seeing as how she was catering to all the other tables around us. The only thing that SAVED this, was a man who wasn't even our waiter. He was a busboy or something. He was super attentive to our drinks and super polite. He took additional orders for us, took our empty plates, and checked up on us regularly. Of course we had gratuity on our large bill however we initially wanted to add to our gratuity. When we found out that the man who was ACTUALLY serving us wasn't getting ANY of the bill, we gave him the extra $20 personally. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE- it was quite loud and busy in the restaurant. And this was around 3:30-7pm on a Friday. Of course it's very possible to have a conversation, but be expected to wait quite awhile in the line. It's more of a casual setting. \\n\\nAll in all, service by MY waitress was horrible. But the staff was good. Not my waitress she sucks and I hope she never sees that gratuity that she doesn't deserve. Food was expensive but not as bad as other fancy restaurants. Food was tasty but not the standards I was expecting. Casual setting. I probably wouldn't go here again unless it's a special occasion. Definitely an experience so no regrets.\",\n",

       " \"Overall good quality food. I think I was just expecting a little more from Gordon Ramsey. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is nice as all restaurants are on the strip. We ordered the onion rings with parmesan and truffle oil, and the two housemade sauces. For burgers I had the farm burger with the egg on top and my boyfriend got the classic. The ingredients were fresh (avocado etc), the patties were generously portioned and perfectly cooked to our liking. However the farm burger could have used a lot more seasoning. With Gordon Ramsey always being so tough on people in his shows, I was a little disappointed that the burger was lacking something as simple as salt. \\n\\nThe waiters presented the drinks, desserts, and restaurant merchandise on an iPad, which enabled a more high impact display. While that was nice, it didn't seem that the high top table we sat at had the space to accommodate. Additionally the rest of the food items for the menu were on a separate print copy, and you couldn't order the drinks or desserts using the iPad. Perhaps they are still testing how they was to integrate the technology, but we just found it slightly piece meal and confusing.\",\n",

The decor of the place had a touch of 'hell' with the wall of fire in front of the restaurant. \\n\\nLuckily, we didn't have to wait that long and was seated right away. We were starving and instantly ordered truffle Parmesan fries and burgers. We got the farm burger and Hell's Kitchen burger. The fries were delicious! Crispy and very flavorful because of the truffle! Noms. The farm burger with the duck breast bacon and egg inside a brioche bun was fabulous, and the Hell's Kitchen burger really packs heat with the roasted jalapeños. I loved it! \\n\\nI regret not ordering the sticky toffee pudding, but I was so stuff from all the food already. Guess it'll be on my bucket list when I go back to Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"My friend and I stumbled across this place at Planet Hollywood while getting our Earl's sandwich fix. I hadn't seen this place at the end of December in 2012, and was intrigued after my experience at his steakhouse was meh. My friend who doesn't really eat hamburgers since they're not healthy had said she would be down to try this place. So we came here the next day for lunch, but the line was super long at 2 PM (next to the flames in the glass wall - very nice touch) so we decided to gamble and come back.\\n\\nWhen we came back, there were not that many people in line, so as we waited, we of course took photos of the flamed glass wall, and perused through the menu.  \\n\\nWe were seated quickly and liked the menu design and settings. The waiter also said we could take the menus as souveniers which was nice of them to let the diners know before hand. Our waiter was very friendly and let us peruse the iPad drink menu. We both got something fruity, and they were tasty, but wish they had mashed up the mint rather than full leaves.\\n\\nI told my friend the photos of the jalapeno poppers looked amazing, so we started off with that. They were the BEST jalapeno poppers ever. 6 Huge roasted peppers with cheddar bacon inside and in a shot glass of cheddar ranch sauce. I saved a shot of the ranch to dip with my fries later on.\\n\\nA lot of yelpers talked about the Farm Burger, with duck breast bacon and a fried egg, but I was more intrigued by the Euro burger since I'm a sucker for goat cheese and arugula. And with truffle aioli? No brainer. My friend who is not a huge GR fan went with the Hell's Kithcen Burger since she loves avocado. Our burgers were cooked to a perfect medium rare. The burgers are not huge but perfect size for me at least. My Euro Burger was spot on, loved all the flavors. My friend's Hell's kitchen burger was okay, but we liked our own better. \\n\\nWe also ordered a side of the truffle parmesean fries, which is definitley made for sharing. Super tasty and my friend commented it comes with homemade ketchup, so has a marinara taste to it.\\n\\nOverall, great service, great food.

Truffle fries were cooked well, and certainly large enough to share. We arrived right as they opened for lunch so we were able to get a table immediately. Like many places in Vegas, they go a bit overboard on the technology, just because they can (ipads for cocktail menus, mobile device for payment, etc), which is ironic because it often makes the process more difficult. All in all, it's a solid restaurant with good service and a nice alternative to just about everything else in Planet Hollywood.\",\n",

My husband got the Hell's Kitchen Burger which good, very filling. Not spicy at all! I got the turkey  burger. Not like any other turkey burger I've tried (in a good way).

The three of us started with some different beers and a wonderful whiskey lemonade cocktail. Then we tried an order of their onion rings. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was the best ever. We had two sauces served with the rings. Amazing! Our burgers were all different and beautifully served. Again, amazing taste! Definitely not your ordinary burgers! I know Gordon Ramsay's passion is taste, presentation, speed of service, and a manageable menu. He delivers excellence here! Everything coming out of the kitchen was beautifully served. We wanted to try an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries and there were so many, along with two different sauces, that we could not finish them all.

I love a good burger and made it a point to visit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on my most recent trip to Vegas. The restaurant is located within Planet Hollywood and is the first restaurant when entering Miracle Mile off of Vegas Boulevard. For a Monday afternoon there was a bit of a line, perhaps 15-20 people and you simply wait in line and aren't given a pager.\\n\\nAfter being seated, our friendly waiter came by to take our drink order and showed us an iPad with a selection of specialty cocktails. Early on I was tempted on ordering one of their massively-sized Devil Dawgs, but thought you can't come to BurGR and not get a burger. After asking our waiter for some personal suggestions, I opted for the honey-pig bao buns as our appetizer and the Euro burger, which he personally recommended. \\n\\nConsidering how busy BurGR was, our drink order and appetizer came out rather quick. My +1 didn't indulge in the bao buns which meant more for me. The roasted pork belly was perfectly tender and the fresh cilantro and honey sauce made for one delicious appetizer. The bao buns dripped with roasted pork juice and their honey-hoisin sauce. \\n\\nAfter ravishing through the two bao buns, the Euro burger came out soon after. I can't stress enough that all their burgers look like masterpieces when served. The Euro burger looked almost too good to eat. The burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood and my burger had a truffle aioli, oven roasted tomato, arugula, and a mouth watering goat cheese that made all the difference. The cook on the medium rare patty was just right and the combination of flavors exploded through every bite. The artisan bun rounded out one of the best burgers I've tried.\\n\\nI have to admit I got a little sad as the meal came to an end. The burger was just right in every aspect. It wasn't a ginormous Vegas-sized burger, but more of a subtle and refined burger by the world-famous Gordon Ramsay. The burger is a little pricey at $15 especially since it doesn't come with any fries or sides. Nonetheless, you are in a Gordon Ramsay establishment and the man is serious about quality control.

I've worked in restaurants and understand that they could be understaffed in the dining room or kitchen that day & that could back things up, but by seeing the number of employees on the floor & in the kitchen I don't think that was the case.

The worst part is NOT ONE staff member smiled in the hour and a half it took us to get our table, eat and leave. (Lunch) Our waitress never returned except to give us the bill. Everyone looks like they hate their job and the vibe was completely thrown off because of this \"I don\\'t want to work here\" attitude.  It was awkward and uncomfortable. By the time we left - we were full of delicious food, but angry from the noise, packed seating arrangement and terrible service from employees whom I suspect do not really care for their jobs. I wouldn\\'t return, although I would get take out if it were available. Don\\'t plan to have a conversation here. It\\'s like eating in a construction zone.',\n",

Anywho let\\'s break this place down yo!?!\\n\\n~~~Wait for a table~~~\\nNormal days wait can be anywhere from 10-20mins, Fridays and weekends you might spend anywhere from 30-45mins.  You can always call ahead of time and ask how long the line queue is.  \\n\\nQuick Tip: Grab a drink from the bar while you wait in line and you can even bring it in with you, cuz when you\\'re in Vegas it\\'s a must to #GetCrunk \\n\\n~~Restaurant Ambiance~~~\\nThey got a great layout, I mean the chairs & tables to the decor are all really something!  They have a bar area and even TVs all around the restaurant so you can catch the game.  We came here around March Madness and it was really really loud and of course you had crunk people at the bar as well.  Also I was in love with the Interactive Touch Screen Menu, more restaurants should have this!?!\\n\\n~~~Food~~~\\nHell\\'s Kitchen Burger - this is a staple and their most ordered burger, the old lady didn\\'t like it but I think it was because she asked for it well done and it dried out the flavor.\\n\\nChanterelle Burger - got this medium well, loaded with mushrooms and drenched with some onion jam.  I was in burger heaven, the most flavorful patty I have ever tasted and the burger buns were good too!?!\\n\\nTruffle Fries - come with two dipping sauces which are really good, but the fries themselves were \"meh\"\\n\\n~~~Service~~~\\nAhhhh-mazing, wouldn\\'t expect anything less from a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant!?!\\n\\n~~~Improvements~~~\\n1. Gotta improve them fries.\\n2. Make a \"Big Option\" for the Burger, it\\'s a very small serving.\\n3. Make your burger option, where you can pick all the yummy add-ins yourself because I wanted a few items from other burgers to be added to my burger.',\n",

I have gotten the Brittania burger on both of my visits and the first time the mango chutney was barely visible. So I made sure to order extra this time.

Highly recommended Also a Dr Brown's Root Beer surprisingly distributed by Canada Dry. \\n\\nNext up were the burgers. I ordered the blue cheese burger which was served on what had to be a homemade bun...light and seeded, it made the meal perfect. The burger was also delicious. Garnished with some arugula it was a simple dish elevated by the bun!!\\n\\nMy husband ordered the American burger and he said it was excellent. \\n\\nThe piece d' resistance however was the coconut pudding strawberry shake dessert which was seriously creative and extraordinary. Topped with a lovely spoonful of whipped cream and a chocolate cookie. So good. \\n\\nThe only odd thing here was what was on the tvs that surround the eating area.

       " \"I really expected a lot out of our recent trip to Burgr while we were visiting Las Vegas. The place looked really cool and the 30-40 minute wait wasn't bad because we could play some games at the casino while waiting. I have seen many of Gordon Ramsey's shows and agree with what he says about food and restaurants. I guess that would be the complaint I have, I went to one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants thinking that here is a man who has learned a way to maintain the quality of food and service at a restaurant while he is not there that would be served if he was there. It was not. I ordered the Hummus, just to be different, after all, everyone at our table is ordering burgers so I am bound to get to try one anyway but hummus? Who serves hummus at a burger place? this must be some good hummus, right? Not really. I could hear Mr. Ramsey in my head pleading with whoever made this hummus to taste what he is serving and SEASON IT. (and wash the green onions before serving them) I sent the hummus back but the server simply asked if I wanted something else, and they were gracious enough to take it off my bill. I thought maybe they would want to know why I sent it back but no one asked. My wife had one of the cheese burgers and kinda the same thing, SEASON IT and learn how to cook a burger right. I seriously couldn't believe she told me she ordered hers well done, I saw her with it med rare and thought to myself she finally ordered a burger the way I like it too but nope, it was just a cook that was probably back there cooking every burger to med rare and slapping them together like they were in a mcdonalds. \\n\\nThe fries are a different situation all together, Holy cow were those good, the Parmesan truffle topping was super good, even made up for the fact that the fries had been sitting in the cone for a while before they were dressed and served.\\n\\nI give this place 2 stars because the fries were really that good, so good that even with being a major disappointment I will still give it more than one star.\\n\\nNo doubt Mr. Ramsey is a good cook and passionate but you can't always expect that you can have several restaurants that will maintain that kind of drive and integrity to make every single customers experience absolutely excellent. I didn't go in looking for something wrong, I went in as a person who admired your work ethic and passion for cooking. I am very disappointed with my experience and although I will no doubt try another one of your restaurants, I will definitely lower my expectations. (Also, if you are going to put hummus on the menu with burgers, it should be the best hummus anyone has ever tasted.)\",\n",

I went during restaurant week and I feel like the staff did a disservice by not telling us about the deals without me prompting them. I didn't hear them tell about the deals to other customers nearby either.\\n\\nI had the chantrelle burger cooked medium. Great flavor with the mushrooms, figgy-onion jam, and the buttered bun. I had the just fries which I love steak fries, but couldn't finish them. And then part of the $20.13 restaurant week price was a sticky toffee push pop which was very good. \\n\\nSolid restaurant in which I'd go back.

We ordered a few different burgers and dishes. The ones that tasted good were the food that I munched off of my parents' dishes instead of my own.\\n\\nI myself am not a big burger fan. But my brother wanted to try it so much so I followed suit. I ordered the honey-pig buns and the chicken burger sliders (both as the snack dishes). Both were Mehh ( a true 3 stars on both of these dishes)\\n\\nChicken sliders: really dry for some reasons; if there was a little more of the sauce, it would have added itself another star in my book. The buns were grilled a little too burnt (I could taste the burnt part- blehh) Not really that good. The chicken was tender enough though, that was probably my favorite part.\\n\\nHoney-Pig Buns: the bun was soft and the pork part was tender and tasted like it really was glazed with honey (in a good way), however, to me, the pickle part made the whole dish tasted weird... like its taste didn't compliment the pork bun at all. So 3 star.\\n\\nMy mother used her motherly instinct that assumed I can eat a lot and that I want to try her dish, so before I could even voice my opinion, she cut for me almost half of the portion of her fish and chip dishes and made me eat them. However, IT WAS REALLY GOOD. The fish was soft and marinated well. If I come back to this, I would definitely get it again!\\n\\nMy brother absolutely LOVEDDDD the Farm Burger. But since he sat too far from me I couldn't steal any piece so no comment from me. But It's something I can make my hubby get it so I can try some :P \\n\\nWaiters are very nice and friendly; convenient location; but for a restaurant made with recipes from a famous chef, it could be better.\",\n",

Our server, MIa, was absolutely great as she had a great attitude, was very knowledgeable about the menu, and conducted herself as a top notch representative of the establishment.  We started out with the pepper poppers, which were AMAZING!  The Hells Kitchen burgers were great and even better with the duck bacon.  The Oreo Cookie shake was the fave at our table but we all wished that all the shakes had less custard and more actual main flavor content. Truffle fries were also a huge hit.  All in all, a fun night with good food.  Price tag was a little steep at $130 but i went in expecting that.  I would go back but only on special occasions.',\n",

There's plenty of time to peruse the menu and decide what you want to eat.\\n\\nWhen I was finally seated, I ordered immediately. The waitress wasn't too into delivering top notch customer friendliness, just getting the job done because the restaurant was so busy and hectic. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which was delicious! Not as spicy as I thought it would be. The time it took me to start waiting in line then get my food was about an hour. Not bad, I guess?\\n\\nIn terms of service, the hostess was nice, as was the bus boy. Perhaps I got a super uptight and busy waitress that was rushing me out of the restaurant.

However, In this line of work, first impressions are sometimes not as important as the last impression. Not sure If I will try another Gordan Ramsay restaurant. \\n\\nBeing in this industry myself, I couldn't help notice a few things:\\nAll the employees wear the same clothing head to toe (men are different from girls). Somewhat weird, I could never work there considering my shoe size!\\nOf the 3 managers who were on duty (I only noticed this because of how over dressed they were to be flipping a hamburger) basically stood in the middle of the restaurant and monitored.

Take everything you know about an average burger joint and take it up a notch from flavor to price. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory location and there was a 20-30 min wait to be seated on a Sunday afternoon. The average price for a burger is $15 and that doesn't include fries or drinks.\\n\\nI opted in for the Hell's Burger or whatever it's called but it's suppose to be spicy and I love spicy.

I think we waited 30-40 mins to receive our food. Altogether we spent roughly an hour and a half to two hours there, now that's a long ass time. \\n\\nThe food was good. The flavors were unique, fresh and basically tasted like a $15 dollar burger. But at the same time I'm not that crazy about it to give it 5 stars. It was good but didn't exactly give me that burger satisfaction I've had before at other places. Just not as juicy as I would've had wanted. \\n\\nThe highlight for me had to be the gooey fries - so good! Crispy thick fries, drizzled over with loads of cheese, bacon, and an EGG!

We actually walked out.\\n\\nI'm adding to my review, because we were really looking forward to having dinner here before the concert. We took bar seating since it would be quickest, and didn't mind the bar section.

She was impressively knocking out drinks and even restocked her own ice. And we also watched the male bartender who took our order, be confused. He would ring out checks and triple count change and the POS (the registration computer) system looked like it was kicking his butt. He would be fiddling with the screen and have this confused look on his face. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the gentleman next to me placed his order as soon as he sat down. His food arrived in minutes, ours were still a no show. Unfortunately the gentleman had to flag down the male bartender to return his burger, he said it was too rare and the fries were undercooked. Not a good sign.\\n\\nWe looked at our cells and saw it was 7:50, couldn't find the male bartender - he disappeared. Flagged down a manager and explained that our food never showed, but we had to get to our concert and she apologized and didn't charge us for our drinks. \\n\\nFrom this experience, it'll be a while before I come back to try the food as everyone raves about it. And we are locals. But from our observation of employees working here, they should hire more females because they were getting the jobs done. I jest, but please help get the male bartender up to speed, because this was a bitter experience for us locals to have in a restaurant like this. The female bartender was kicking ass.

How much more amazing could we have had without amazing service and sweet people. I came today expecting long lines and regular burgers with okay service.

They were actually overcooked and the ketchup that came with it couldn't really save them.\\n\\nThe reason for the 3-star review was because for some bizarre reason, they mixed up our order with the table behind us and gave them our order first.  They apologized and served our fries while waiting for our order to arrive, but I told them to return the fries because I would prefer to eat them fresh with my burger.  Thankfully, it didn't take them long to come up with our order so I appreciated them correcting their mistake in a timely fashion.  However, I thought that some sort of compensation for that big mistake would've been nice, but they didn't offer anything which kind of soured up the whole experience.\\n\\nSo even though the experience was mediocre, the burger was good enough for me to come back.

They look good for Instagram pics but when I came here for the grand opening, they tasted mediocre at best. I was disappointed. A lot of their burgers sounds like it'd be packed with flavor but the final product is less than its parts. The fries/condiments and milkshakes however are good, which is nice. It's just a damn shame that their burgers can't even compare to Bachi Burger, Holsteins, In-N-Out, Bacon & Truffles, Shake Shack or Fukuburger. Hopefully it improves but BurGR has some serious stiff competition to beat if they even want to be included on a list of heavy hitters. For a celebrity chef it's hard to expect much if anything but you would think such a vocal man would have more to say with his food (even though it's just his name he cashed out). Overrated is an understatement. Don't trust anyone who thinks the burgers are here cause they're clearly not talking about the taste.\\n\\nAlso of note the three blonde hostesses at front should be fired. They're rude and unfriendly demeanor is the exact antithesis of what their job entails but perhaps their crummy attitude reflects that of an understaffed restaurant serving hot pucks guised as burgers. Seriously what is going on in this restaurant??? How can the food AND the service be this bad? It's certainly not a matter of budget given the venue and location. Perhaps Gordon ought to do an episode of Hell's Kitchen in his own goddamn Soulja Boy sell out of a restaurant that is BurGR. Just plain awful.

The Truffle fries were very underwhelming as well. The wifey got the Hell's Kitchen burger and she loved it. I tried it and it was pretty good.

This restaurant is strictly made for burgers as the entrees but there are fries, salads, and bomb shakes. I thought this place wasn't gonna be worth the money but it was actually good food for a change. One thing I hate being in Vegas is paying for overpriced food and it wasn't even enjoyable.

So what is the first thing I'm craving?  A burger, of course.  So, BurGR it is.  \\n\\nService:  \\nUnique situation when we arrived for dinner.  It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.  Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time. Not a big deal to me.  Safety first, right?  Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.  Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.  So far, so good. \\n\\nThe Food:\\n-American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.  But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.  So, I had them add an extra patty.  This was perfect, this was huge.  My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.  My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.  The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger. I managed to eat the whole thing.  Obviously, I was satisfied.  Obviously, I recommend.  \\n\\n-Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.  But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.  I thought that these were pretty good. They hook up the fries here.  It's big enough for 4.  \\n\\n-Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good. I thought that they were just okay.  Maybe it's the batch that we got.  I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.  Still tasted good, though. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.  Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.  \\n\\nPS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.

I liked this combination of ingredients and the burger was actually pretty moist considering it was well done.  We didn't get the truffle fries because the serving size is huge and there's no way we could have eaten all that in addition to our burgers.  They did look very tasty, though.

I had the truffle burger and my husband had the farm house duck bacon burger. The shake no.5 was something I never tried before and it was so good, a must try if you love nutella! Everything was delicious. The service was okay not all that great but it's Vegas so It is what it is. I'm looking forward to eating here again when we come back to Vegas.\",\n",
       " 'Amazing burgers and sides. Order the jalapeño poppers and you get a spicy surprise with one of them. Truffle fries are amazing not greasy at all. And the burgers....well you will mop the grease off your plate with your fries.',\n",
       " \"We visited Gordon Ramsay Burger during a recent trip to Vegas. I have the Blue cheese burger with figgy jam with truffle fries. The food was great but the service wasn't on par for a Gordon Ramsay establishment. You see him on tv and wouldn't expect to see the inside of the restaurant to seem so low budget and the waiters uniforms were beyond horrible. Some of the waitresses had on dresses that ended right below their asses and the other uniform was tacky jeans with a Gordon Ramsay Burger patch on the back pocket. I understand it's a casual restaurant but there's something as too casual.\",\n",
       " \"This place is EXPENSIVE. It was a novelty to try a Gordon Ramsay burger, in fact I even gave this place a 2nd chance after being disappointed the first time. That's how much I wanted to like this place.\\n\\nThe presentation of the food was great but the flavor was just plain boring. It didn't have any unique flavor. It was just average. Also, both times I visited, I asked for the burger to be cooked rare, but got medium-rare. Not a deal breaker but when you are paying $15 for just the burger with no fries included, you expect to be able to get it cooked right. \\n\\nHonestly, Carl's Jr., Wendy's & In & Out make better burgers. Each fast food joint has a unique flavor to their burgers, but Gordon Ramsey just refuses to take any chances. It all tastes bland even though it looks like it's going to taste amazing.\\n\\nI spent over $55 on myself for a burger, fries, shake and beer with tip. Not to mention it is hard as hell to get to this restaurant unless you are walking along the strip. You have to park behind the Miracle Mile shops and walk all the way through the shopping mall to get back to the strip. Not an easy ordeal.\\n\\nI don't recommend this place for locals. It's clearly aimed at the impulsive tourists. Nothing more than a cash grab for Gordon Ramsay.\",\n",
       " \"I've had better. I really expected to be blown away like I did at GR Steak.\\n\\nThe burgers were obviously really good quality but I just had better. If you ever are in San Francisco, go have a 4505 burger. You will know what I mean.\\n\\nService is pretty good. The host however had an attitude. The restrooms are outside of the restaurant. When I came back to the restaurant, the host even questioned me. I looked at her and was like, you just sat us. You don't remember? Anyway.\\n\\nMake sure you have your TotalRewards card so you can get a discount.\",\n",

       " \"Not sure what the rave is about. My Hell's Kitchen burger (medium rare) was fine but nothing amazing or even memorable. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However the jalapeño poppers were great.. the sauce is perfectly creamy and highly addictive! I was secretly hoping I would get the spicy popper but no such luck. The wait was an hour long but the hostess let us put our name down and walk around until our table was ready, which was really appreciated. Although the burger was a bit disappointing, I might just be back for those poppers.\",\n",
       " \"I am a burger freak! I made it my mission to find the best burger. So when my boyfriend and I went on a trip to Vegas I was so excited to try Gordon Ramsay's burger.\\nI love Gordon, I'm a fan, and I love watching his TV shows, listening to his comments, and most of the times I share the same opinion with him.\\n But I have to say after visiting burGR in Vegas,\\n I was pretty disappointed.\\nExcept of the beautiful presentation and the beautiful looks of the dishes there wasn't much taste to it.\\nI will use his word when I say the burger was bland, \\nplus it was over cooked, which was weird, since when you go to a chef's restaurant, you don't expect these kind of mistakes.\\nI wish I would be more excited but unfortunately my only experience is that it was nice and not more than that.\",\n",
       " \"I LOVE Gordon Ramsay so I was really excited to visit BurGR after seeing it on the MasterChef challenge last season. I saw those awesome flames out front and BAM I knew I was having a burger here. \\n\\nThey don't take reservations but the line to get a table moved very quickly around late lunch time. The prices are also great or at least compared to what I would pay for a bomb burger here in NYC. \\n\\nThe portions on the sides are pretty big so I would recommend sharing them. We were so stuffed from our breakfast we decided to split a burger too! I decided we should have the uber cheese burger.. I am a cheese slut... I love it mmmmm. \\n\\nWe asked for the burger medium rare and when it came to the table I was pretty convinced it was rare rare rare... the BF was happy but I couldn't do it. The texture is too much for me when it is this rare. I said something to the waiter and at first he argued with me but then snapped out of it and had the kitchen make us a new one.\\n\\nThe 2nd burger came out really quickly and was absolutely delicious. I couldn't leave this joint without one of those amazing looking milk shakes either so I was excited when the waiter told us we could get it to go. We had the carmel chocolate one and the hazelnut coffee one. They were lush oh my god. SO good but also SO filling. I wish I could say I finished mine but no such luck. \\n\\nI am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can come back for more burger heaven. :-)\",\n",
       " 'Ever since watching Hell\\'s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares, I have grown fond of the character Gordan Ramsey. Indeed, his television persona is unabashed by telling chefs who fail. and why they fail. This alongside talent critique Simon Cowell both evoke a kind of brutal honesty unPC \"truthiness\" post 9-11. They may even well have been the first critiques to pioneer this type of mentality. And this was an interesting marketing allure with a huge payoff, because the general public craved honesty that was not necessarily PC. The result, an instant hit!\\n\\nI have however heard numerous chefs criticizing Chef Gordan Ramsey, claiming that he is really a charlatan, and his \"cooking\" is really just marketing tactics and hype. How do I see it you ask?\\n\\nI ordered the Farm Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.\\n\\nAs a native of Chicago, I have to say, that this burger has to contend with Kuma\\'s Corner, which I highly consider the best burger I have eaten: both in presentation, ambiance, and service. \\n\\nThe burger comes a la carte. Meaning, the burger is priced at 15$ dollar but without fries. But, I\\'m in a spending mood, so I purchased the truffle parmesan fries as well.\\n\\n1) The burger was good. I ordered it medium rare, and that\\'s exactly what I got. It was not better than Kuma\\'s corner unfortunately. Recall back to  the  infamous episode-- \"Amy\\'s Bakery,\" where Gordan Ramsey criticizes the blue ribbon burger for being soggy. In an ironic twist, I felt this was the main problem with this burger. It was soggy. I don\\'t know if the egg contributed to the problem. Maybe next time I will get anything other than the farm burger.\\n\\nBurger is 3/5 stars.\\n\\n\\n2) The Truffle Parmesan Fries at a resounding $11 dollars, was absolutely flawless, and may be the best fries I have eaten in my life. The fries were hand cut and crunchy and came with truffle aioli (mayonnaise like truffle mushroom sauce), and ketchup curry. The ketchup curry was also some of the best ketchup I\\'ve eaten in my life!\\n\\nFries are 5/5 stars.\\n\\n\\nSo, overall my experience was 4/5 stars. The service was also exceptional, and best of all, for one person, there was NO WAIT! If you are on a tight budget, I would actually suggest the truffle paremsan fries above anything else! This is a must have on your las vegas trip!',\n",
       " \"Nice place. Very busy. Packed the 2 person tables in the room like sardines though. Could tell this place was designed for maximum capacity/profit. Could easily hear the couple's conversation beside you. Aisles were very narrow in table area. \\nNow for the food. Onion Ring appetizers were great. Dipping sauces marched perfectly. Plenty of drink choices. Entree burgers were absolutely DELICIOUS. I got the main burger, the Gordon Ramsey something or another. The fries, however, lacked in taste and the dipping sauces for them didn't go well. I pretty much left my entire order of fries untouched. My wife got the Sweet Potato fries and she said the same. \\n\\nThat said, we spent $105 for two people for burgers and fries. Yes, it's Vegas and yeah it's a hot TV personality chef. Just seemed like a little much.\",\n",
       " \"The wait is very long but totally worth it! Best meal of my life. I went with my family of four and we each ordered a burger along with an order of Truffle Fries and Onion Rings. The four burgers were amazing and the fries and onion rings were the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was a lot of fun and did I mention the food was fantastic? MUST VISIT!\",\n",
       " \"Had the American Burger and it was FABULOUS!!!  the price was not too high and the burger was one of the best I've ever had.  Service was friendly and the food comes out quick despite how busy they are. Very popular place. I definitely will return.\",\n",
       " 'What a burger! My favorite burger was Zinburgers in Tucson. BurGR in Las Vegas has now become our Gold standard. First off, our server Karlenda is a pro. This woman knows her product knowledge. Gordon you need to put her in a trainer position. She should be training your new staff how to make recommendations.\\n\\nThe Burger was the best Ever. All the components complimented each other.  Cant say enough about our meal and Karlenda',\n",
       " 'Good food but the atmosphere is very loud.  Service was spectacular as well',\n",
       " '..order the hog burger and the gooey fries!!!..yum!!!...sis ordered the uber cheese burger..they have a secret menu - gordon burger..will definitely try it next time...service was slow too...',\n",
       " \"First food was delish! Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with Just Fries. Burger was very well made with the proper balance of all of it's ingredients. The jalapenos on this burger made it really delish. The fries were quite tasty because they were so natural tasting,..no b.s. ingredients here. There's really only one reason why I'm not giving things place a 5 starts...it's the drink menu. Don't come here expecting delish food AND great drinks. You'll be disappointed with the drinks. They are very fruity and definitely cater to tourists who don't care. However if you don't care about the drinks and just want great food...interpret this review as a 5.\\nAs for the staff, seemed friendly and well mannered.\",\n",
       " \"This was my first time here and I wasn't sure if this was just hype or if the food was good. I can tell you my burger was exceptional!! It was cooked and seasoned to perfection, it didn't need any condiments to add taste or flavor to the burger. It was so good I craved eating it again the next day.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, one million times yes! We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and got a table immediately. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the food but not about the beer (I was unfamiliar with Boddington\\'s and asked if it was a light beer and she asked if I meant \"light in color or...\" and then told me it was dark. Thankfully I asked for a sample and decided on something else). We ordered two Farm Burgers, which don\\'t come with fries, so we got the truffle parmesan fries too. The burgers were cooked perfectly, one medium and one medium rare, and the toppings were fantastic. The Farm Burger has cheddar, a fried egg, and duck bacon and it was the absolute perfect combination! The fries were great too, served with a few dipping sauces (the aioli is the best).\\n\\nTruthfully the food here was better than the food we got at Gordon Ramsay Steak. I wish Gordon would open a BurGR on the east coast because I really wanted to try the Hell\\'s Kitchen burger too! This is on our list to come back to when we return to Vegas.',\n",
       " 'Even before you set foot into the restaurant, you may be welcomed with a long waiting line. If you do, keep calm and line up, as the line moves faster than you think. I\\'m not sure if you are able to make reservations beforehand, but ask the hostess if it\\'s possible. The restaurant sadly doesn\\'t take reservations online.\\n\\nThe menu is very simple, it\\'s all on one page with 5-10 selections for each category. A more visible quality of the menu can be found here. We did our research about BurGR before coming, so we ordered two burgers (The Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger and Farm Burger), truffle parmesan fries, and two shakes for dessert (Shake #4 and #5). We also ordered a beer from the drinks list which was available by iPad when you asked your server.\\n\\nThe restaurant was very lively with no empty tables. We were very excited to try our gourmet burgers because it was voted as the \\'Best Tourist Food that\\'s \"Actually Good\"\\' by Vegas Seven in 2013. I was too excited about their curry ketchup, truffle aioli, burgers of course, and their ultimate shakes that everyone kept raving about. The atmosphere was quite cozy because of the large fireplace at BurGR, but the busy restaurant came hard upon the servers and so the service we received wasn\\'t anything great.\\n\\nNot so long after, our meals started to arrive. Starting with the fries, they were very crispy, none of them soggy from too much oil, and had truffle salt and truffle parmesan on top. You could really smell the real truffle from the fries which I was very surprised about. Normally, and when I had tried truffle fries before at other burger joints, I was never able to smell or taste the truffle in the fries; however, along with the truffle aioli, these fries were serious about their truffle! Hubby and I were very, very happy people...now we can\\'t have truffle fries anywhere else.\\n\\nWe asked for a side of curry ketchup with our truffle fries because many recommended we do so. The curry ketchup is available when you order their \"Just fries\". I don\\'t think it cost us extra for the side, but even if there was a surcharge, we would\\'ve gotten it anyway. After trying my french fries with curry ketchup, I realized I want lots of it at home. I wish it was available for purchase everywhere and anywhere. The combination of ketchup and curry was perfect.\\n\\nI chose to have the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I mostly ordered it because of the duck meat because I\\'ve never had duck breast bacon before, and also never had it in my burger as a topping. After trying the burger, I found the bacon actually a little too salty so a little overpowering for my taste. It was great at first, but as I slowly finished my burger, I realized it was getting saltier and saltier, and there were not enough toppings inside the burger to offset the saltiness. Yes, the fried egg was a good touch, and it wasn\\'t overcooked, but it wasn\\'t enough to balance the saltiness. Now that I think about it, the Farm burger sounds like a good thing to eat for brunch...I mean, it has bacon, cheese, and egg inside your burger! Overall, the burger was great, but compared to the Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger, it ranked second in our books.\\n\\nThe Hell\\'s Kitchen burger is probably the best burger we had ever tried so far in our lives. Complete with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes, you know it\\'s a good burger at first bite. There wasn\\'t really anything that we didn\\'t like about the burger, other than the fact that I didn\\'t order it! The rich, savoury flavours were balanced out by the avocado, and instead of your standard ketchup, the real roasted tomatoes were great. Next time we\\'re in Vegas, I know for sure that we are going back to BurGR and ordering this again! This burger is a must try when you\\'re at BurGR!\\n\\nOf the two shakes that we tried, this oreo shake was my favourite, while hubby preferred the coffee shake. Shake #4 is an oreo shake with creme brûlée pudding on top as well as an oreo cookie. I needed to order this and try it because the oreo cookie is my favourite snack. I couldn\\'t really imagine how oreo and creme brûlée would taste together, but whatever happened in BurGR\\'s kitchen, the combination was SO GOOD. The rich sweetness can probably be overpowering for some (ie. my hubby), but if you have a sweet tooth, you\\'d probably thank me for introducing this shake to you. Shake #5 is probably a better choice if you want to try something less sweeter, although it\\'s still quite sweet. I know the amount of calories in these shakes are probably heart attack worthy, but I\\'d rather run for 10 miles after my meal instead of not trying it!\\n\\nOverall, I believe this is how a burger joint should be done. In my opinion, it is better than Shake Shack, Umami burger, In-n-out Burger, and all other independent burger chains out there. If you\\'re a burger lover, this place must be on your to-do list! To me, Gordon Ramsay\\'s BurGR is a must try!',\n",

We couldn't resist.. 2 girls with big stomachs- NO problem. \\nFirst, the burgers were just OK. Nothing spectacular- a slice of meat in between 2 sesame buns. My chicken burger tasted very organic-Y, the burger meat tasted like there were mixed in veges, which is a plus. The appetizers were delish, the truffle fries came with 2 dipping sauces- an aioli and a Bloody Mary-tasting kind of ketchup. Plus plus! The jalapeño poppers were deep fried with a type of bacon, cheese filling. Plus plus plus! \\nHowever, who would have thunk that the poppers were only about 3$ less than the price of my burger?! Huh!? \\nOverall, good food.. But I think this is just a hyped up burger joint.\",\n",

The servers were excellent and very friendly and I have to say both burgers we ordered were very good. The buns were excellent and the meat was cooked to perfection. If I had to put a negative it would be the physical location of the restaurant, it seemed kind of squished into the Planet Hollywood and was a bit noisy. Nonetheless we would definitely be back and we enjoyed our experience tremendously! Highly recommend',\n",

       " \"So...my first lunch experience here was rather underwhelming. I had such high hopes for their Blue Burger, but it ended up rather dry (I had it cooked medium). Their Roasted Jalapeño Poppers were rather tasty though. I personally don't think it's worth the 45 minute wait, but fortunately you're able to leave your name and number with them and they will text you when your table is ready (I believe if you're in a party of 4+). I am open to trying them out a second time, but with so many other eateries to try out, it's honestly not at the top of my list.\",\n",
       " \"Gordon Ramsay Burger is not your usual burger place, it fit well with the vegas strip.\\n\\nAmazing sweet potato fries, those were some of the best I had ever eat, it mix with vanilla powder, and the fries below of the cone were not as tasty and a bit overcooked.  Our group orders two burger, the farm and hell burger.  The burger was probably 1/3lb, there not big but just about right if you eating solo.  The buns were sesame both side; first time I see this in a burger bun.  It reminds me like those sesame bagel.  I was not a fan of those burger bun but there were definite unusual, the hell burger were supposed to be very spicy, so I told to lower the spice.  The spice level came way out very weak and defeat the purpose.  \\n\\nThe service was good, refill water quick.  However was annoyed by their keep trying to sell us the dessert menu.  The food is good but not worth the price tag, since this is the strip is not a bad deal, despite burger cost $15 and fries were almost $10.  After all Subway nearby cost as much $10 for a foot long isn't such bad trade off.  The check comes with a ipod with a thank you message from Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant atmosphere was modern inside, but the attraction is the big frame display of the restaurant. If you hungry.  If you are very hungry, better off goes to buffet or something, this however is a great  mid night meal after a club or a show.\\n\\nTips:\\nBring you total reward card, it save you $1 from any items in the menu.\",\n",
       " \"Why do restaurants like this make their staff wear extremely unflattering uniforms. It's supposed to make the place fit the brand, but when your staff isn't a bunch of manikins, it's distracting. Anyway, we were seated immediatly, but then service became very slow and odd. It took a while for the waitress to come by and when she did, she dropped off an ipad that contains drinks and dessert information only, but then didn't take any drink orders or offer water. It took forever for her to come back and another waiter checked on us and rushed our drinks out. \\n\\nThe menu is rather smallish, but they do right by burgers. Flavorful, juicy, just the right size. Quality ingredients and perfect prep make the difference. The duck bacon on the Farm Burger, unreal. I had the chanterelle burger, which was also good with arugula, chanterelles, and fig jam. I wanted the farm burger so bad, but had to watch the bf eat is as I avoid dairy. Sides are not included with your sammie so, be prepared for sticker shock. Sweet potato fries can act as dessert, but a milk shake ordered at our table can act as a meal.

It was perfectly cooked and the sauces to dip made it even more amazing. I got the hell's kitchen burger and it was so good, I did wish there were more jalapeños but they gave me so much avocado in my burger so I guess that evens it out. My boyfriend got the hog burger and he loved it, it's a pork burger and it was cooked very well and he liked it but he did say he preferred a regular burger over the pork burger. We also ordered French fries but they were quite large. They were more like chips than French fries in my opinion, and we prefer smaller crispy fries. \\n\\nAlso got shake #4 togo and it was very good, creme Brule pudding with an oreo shake and cookie, one of the best shakes I've ever had.

Also, there\\'s no way you can reserve here, so that long line makes the place seem pretty enticing as well. Oh, and not to mention a literal fire incased in glass window that really grabs your eye. But anyways, expect a 20+ minute wait near lunch or dinner time.\\n\\nOk now to the food. To start off, we had the \"Just Fries.\" And they were pretty good fries - nothing too special but well fried. The onion rings were huge, and well-fried as well. I had the Gordon Ramsay burger (off-menu), which seemed like the \"everything burger\" as it had the regular beef patty, duck bacon, avocado, etc. It was... ok... Honestly the flavor was too much. And, in the end, everything just tasted too salty.\\n\\nThe service was pretty efficient for what it\\'s worth. We asked for new plates after we finished our fries, and our waitress quickly brought them out. Granted we were seated literally in front of where the waiters had the computers to put-in orders and print out receipts, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if other areas get overlooked because of the sheer number of people in the venue.',\n",

It was soooo good.\\n\\nOur waiter, David, was excellent!!!! \\n\\nWe were not going to come because there was always a line, but it was worth the wait, for sure!!! \\n\\nAlso, if you have a Total Rewards card and you're a platinum/diamond member, you get to skip the line.

Overall, I liked it because of the pickled toppings that went with it. \\n\\nFarm burger- duck breast bacon cheddar and fried egg. This was one of the best burger I have had in a long time! They egg yolk was perfectly cooked to how I like it, runny. The duck breast bacon was good but a little too salty but still good. The hamburger buns were very fluffy and compliment the burger meat well. It did not overwhelm the burger. \\n\\nMy husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was very spicy but he loved it. The avocado was delicious with the burger. Meat was juicy and the burger was very flavorful. The bun on this burger was the same as the farm burger. Fluffy and went well with the burger.\\n\\nMy siblings got the Hog Burger and enjoyed it very much so. Juicy, cooked to perfection of medium rare with the awesome bun. \\n\\nWe would all come back here again next time. Totally worth your money!\",\n",

       " \"This is an interesting restaurant. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel. Since it so prominently featured Gordon Ramsay, I thought it would be a little cleaner. Also, the casino smoke comes in all the time, but you can just pretend it is the ash from the window fire display thing. The burgers are very good and so are the onion rings. The staff workers were decent but took away plates prematurely. The TV's suffer from burn in because they are plasma TVs and display the same thing all day long.\",\n",

I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, I forgot which one that my wife had, but she said her mouth was watering while she ate it. We got the sweet potato fries by accident (suppose to be regular fries) but we told them to leave them and we were glad we did because they were like desert. The jalapeno poppers were great and over all we really enjoyed the whole experience.',\n",

It's hard to tell WTF Planet Hollywood is - is it a mall? A hotel? A casino? Weird, since I think of it as a TGI Friday's with a Hollywood theme, but whatever. I'm sure a name and concept change is coming in the not-so-distant future. So, the burgers - were awesome!!! I had the American (I know, I know - boring!!!) and my fiance had the Farm (egg, duck bacon - he was instantly in love). Onion rings were amazing. The drinks are listed on an iPad. Totally impersonal and ridiculous - the one our waiter had took a dump while he was trying to show it to us, and he awkwardly scurried away to get us a new one. I hate those things, I hope they go out of style ASAP. I would definitely go back for more of those rings and one of those tasty sounding shakes!\",\n",

The service was really good in general.   \\n\\nI ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added a fried egg to it because I love fried eggs on my burger.  Was the burger good?  Yes, but not worth an hour wait or the average sticker price of $15 a burger.  For that price I actually prefer Red Robin (I know, how blasphemous but so true).  And that even comes with bottomless fries and the burgers are juicier.  The fries here were pretty good but not worth the high price tag.  I did try someone's Oreo shake and it was REALLY good.  That's probably worth ordering for sure.  \\n\\nI'm glad I tried this once but I probably won't come back again, nor recommend this place.  Not worth the wait or the price.\",\n",

Decent burgers, but they didn't taste fresh or juicy. Truffle fries were ok but not very well seasoned. I'd shake it up a bit, but I think the bottom portion of the fries where all the seasoning is, is just unsalvageable. \\n\\nNot a restaurant to rave about or even suggest going to if you're staying in Vegas.\",\n",

We checked in at the counter, gave them my cell phone so they could text me when the table was ready. We took some pictures in front of the flames and the total wait was maybe 10-15 mins. I love this text waitlist so if it was any longer we could just wander about. \\n\\nFOOD: My bf and I had eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we just split the Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger. They were nice and actually split it in half for us and brought an extra plate. I liked it, it was just the right amount of spicy but it wasn\\'t the best burger of my life, which sadly I was expecting. We also ordered regular fries and my friends got the truffle fries.  Both fries were meh. They were both super hot (temp) but still kinda hard and airy at the same time. The truffle fries and regular fries all came with different dipping sauces. None of them blew my mind.  \\n\\nI was also excited to try the shake since they looked so good on yelp!  We split the #1 (caramel pudding + chocolate shake+ toffee cookie). The menu says \"shake\\'\" but it LITERALLY is pudding. When I think shake, I just assume ice cream shake and so this was SO not what I was expecting. It was like eating a jello-pudding cup of thick chocolate PUDDING with a layer of caramel on the top 1/3 of it.  :( \\n\\nOVERVIEW: Certain expectations are sometimes the worse because this happens where I wasn\\'t blown away and I don\\'t agree with most of the yelpers.

The decor was tasteful and unique; it definitely felt like a higher-end burger joint. Service was also great. Our server was attentive, helpful, and enthusiastic. \\n\\nMy friend and I split a Euro Burger and we got the sweet potato fries to split between 4 of us. They brought out the burger already cut in half with an extra plate, which was super nice. The burger itself was pretty good, but a bit on the pricey end for what you get ($16). It wasn't the greatest burger I've ever had, but was still interesting and tasty. The Euro burger had truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato. The goat cheese was pretty prevalent, but the other ingredients were pretty forgettable. The sweet potato fries ($9) were amaze! I'm not really a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but these were so unique that you can't not like them. First of all, the presentation is pretty intriguing-- the healthy dose of crisp, piping hot fries are served in a metal cone alongside a shaker of vanilla powdered sugar and a side of honey jalapeño mayo. (Ew, the more I think about dipping fries in mayo, I get grossed out. At the time, these were delicious.) The truffle fries scent was pretty much wafting throughout the restaurant, so I'd definitely like to try these next time. \\n\\nIt's worth checking out, but more for the non-burger parts of their menu. I personally liked Holsteins better!\",\n",
       " 'Got there at 7PM just before what looked like the dinner rush with a party of 3 on Tuesday night.  Got seated fairly quickly and the service was great.  Ordered the farm burger, fries, and a shake.  If you plan on eating fries get one order to share between 2-3 people because they are very generous with their portions!  The burger was amazing, but shake #3 really stole the show for me.  My friends ordered Shakes #2 and #4 as well and all were equally as delicious.  Total bill came out to about $40-50 per person.  A very good place to start off your visit to Vegas with.  Will definitely be coming back!',\n",

I\\'ll still put in my two cents:\\n\\nAfter finishing the meal, my thought was that those giving Burgr 4* don\\'t get around much. Maybe they live in a city with lousy food and this really mediocre burger is \"the best ever\".\\n\\nMy first reaction to the menu was that I may come back. There are a lot of fun items on it in addition to the burgers. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and the Aioli / Parmesan fries. This was on the strong recommendation of the server (and many reviews here). In the end: Ho-Hum cheese, ho-hum duck bacon, a fried egg that was over done ( the yolk should be runny and become like a sauce to the burger; it was fully cooked). Worse yet, my Medium-Rare burger came medium-well. I wanted to yell out \"You Donkey! You overcooked the #@$%@ Burger\". I dealt with it as unless something egregiously bad I don\\'t like to send it back as I know it goes straight to the bin. The parmesan fries are large rectangular cut. The aioli was good, but that\\'s hard to mess up. The fries were a bit chewy. Not crisp outside, soft inside as they should be. I get way better fries from fry trucks at home.\\n\\nI don\\'t get the four stars. Even if the meat was done right, it would not have been great.',\n",

The burgers are a good size and is never too greasy which I hate. Then we would always get the truffle fries which is delicious with their duo dipping sauce.

The burger was perfectly cooked medium rate and plentiful, with duck bacon and a fried egg, heavenly.

Just not $14 good; especially for not coming with a side. The $17 above came from the fact that mushrooms on top were $3 without warning from the waitress. I was really looking forward to this sandwich, but the overall experience led to a bust. I've had burgers that were more enjoyable than this at a much lower cost. Having to be there for 2.5 hours due to slow service wasn't cool; neither was having to split our own check while ensuring that taxes were properly calculated.

The fries come in a cone shaped container and there is plenty for a few people to share. Chipotle ketchup and Curry Ketchup\\n\\nHoney Pig Bao Buns- Great take on the Asian dish. The pork is well flavored and the bun provides a subtly sweet taste and soft texture that complements the pork and carrots. It comes with two buns to share!\\n\\nChanterelle Burger- It comes with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Arugula, and a thick juicy beef patty.

The truffle fries were great--Well seasoned and crispy. The Hell's Kitchen burger was cooked to a perfect, moist medium rare, and I loved how the jalapeño aioli and roasted jalapeños gave it a really great kick. \\n\\nSounds like I should give a higher rating right? There was just one major issue I had...The burger was underseasoned :( It seriously tasted like the meat patty had NO salt. So tragic. To me, an under-seasoned burger is a pretty big crime for a burger joint. I'm sure Gordon Ramsay himself would say the same.\\n\\nI took a bite of my boyfriend's Euro Burger, and this didn't seem to a problem. Maybe because the sharpness of the goat cheese compared to the milder flavor of my asadero cheese, or maybe because his burger was actually seasoned better than mine.

Although I wasn't hungry, I couldn't bring myself to order a salad at a burger joint, especially one that demands such a long wait.

Of course, quality of meat and seasoning are the other factors. \\n\\nThis place nailed it all and what happened next was me devouring the entire burger.

       " \"Well, Gordon Ramsay can criticize any restaurant he wants to in my book. The Hell's Kitchen burger was outstanding... The best I've had. I've never been so thrilled to spend $15.00 on a burger. \\n\\nFull disclosure: I had a dream last night about going back to Vegas just for this burger. Yeah. \\n\\nI liked the truffle fries and was especially surprised by the mustard. But next time I think I'll put the nine dollars I spent on my fries towards a second hamburger.\",\n",
       " 'Food was great.  Sweet potato fries were outstanding.  The chili dog was awesome.  Service great.',\n",
       " \"After hearing so many good things about this place for years, we finally tried it. The service was very good. I had the Britannia burger and it was excellent. Cooked perfectly and the sweet to salty combination was perfect with its mango chutney and cheddar cheese. The meat was superb and cooked exactly how I ordered it, medium rare. I was really disappointed with the fries and the ketchup that came with them.  \\nThe service and customer service was great. The server accidentally hit the shake straw on the plate and it flipped up and splattered on my white top. She was very apologetic and the manager came over and offered dry cleansing and then comped our appetizer. It was an accident, I declined the dry cleaning but it was nice they offered. \\nWe waited an hour for a table and with no reservations as an option and it being so popular, that's a negative. I would go back but I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've ever had. Probably a close second though. Overall I think it I would have enjoyed it more and rated it a 4 stars had it not been for the lousy fries, long wait and limited menu options.\",\n",
       " 'Lives up to its name. Food is well prepared and the service is amazing. I ordered the farm burger which was delicious and truffle fries. I found some interesting things about this place. The menu has a cool design of gordon ramsay, also they bring you an ipad to look over drinks and desserts and at the end a little survey on an ipod\\n\\nThe reason i am giving 4 stars is that the burgers are great but not the best i tried. Lacking a custom build burger menu in my opinion.',\n",
       " \"I ordered the Farm Burger.  It had duck bacon and a fried egg on it.  I ordered it mid-rare and it came out perfectly cooked.  I liked it but I didn't love it like I'd expected.  It lacked saltiness. Maybe the egg yolk got in the way of the duck bacon flavor.\\nTruffle Parmesan fries were good but the parmesan became a separate entity as it didn't stick to the fries.  It just flaked off.  The sauces that came on the side were delicious.\\nThe chicken wings were underwhelming.  I couldn't taste enough wasabi and not enough 'hellfire'.\\n\\nMy buddy ordered the Chanterelle Burger, mid-rare and it came out well done.  That pretty much ruined the flavor it might have had.  We couldn't taste the figgy onion jam it was supposed to have had.  We didn't make a fuss, nor did we want to wait for another burger to be made correctly.\\n\\nMy kids each had the Standard Dawg.  Huge and DELICIOUS!  Yay!  They are cooked differently than any dawg I've had.  Some kinda wiener magic happening there.  The bun was cool, too.  Kinda like a pretzel.\\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the Butterscotch Pudding and Banana Shake.  LOVED this.  And I don't even love shakes, ever.  This was fanf*ckingtastic.  It comes in a tall, slender glass, topped with a big layer of pudding, fresh whipped cream and a snickerdoodle cookie.  Every single layer of flavor worked outrageously well together.  I would go back just for this.  In fact, I'd try all the other shakes, too.\\n\\nService was fine.  Our waitress seemed like a pleasant automaton.\\n\\nI like that the kitchen is open so you can see them working in there.\\n\\nI wish I had been more impressed with the burgers.\",\n",
       " 'The jalepeno burger and truffle fries are a must!!! Came here during the EDC weekend so you can imagine that it was super packed already. The line was wrapping around the whole place and when we asked how long the wait would be, they said about an hour and a half. So we decided to just to-go it. Plan accordingly if you want to try!',\n",
       " \"Easily one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. I ordered the Gordon Ramsay Burger with bacon, cheese, lettuce, and a medium cooked patty. The patty is what makes the burger so delicious. It's applewood smoked and just irresistible. The burger is juicy and perfectly seasoned. Also the Parmesan truffle fries are thick and amazing with the aioli. They have dessert, which I ordered these peanut butter push pops. They were layers of goodness. Also, the Oreo creme brûlée shake is extremely sweet and heavy. If you have a big sweet tooth get the shake. Plus the service here was amazing. When in Vegas, eat at Burgr.\",\n",
       " \"Honestly, I wasn't mind blown by the food but it was a good experience. I was really glad they use a texting service to inform you once your table is ready for your group. (The line outside the place is only for tables for 2.) My friends and I were able to explore the mall within Planet Hollywood for about 45 minutes while we waited to receive a text back.\\n\\nI ordered the Chanterelle Burger and felt like I couldn't taste much of the other flavors aside from the meat patty. But the burger comes with a pretty large patty, so I felt like I got my money's worth as it filled me up like crazy! I had a bite of my sister's Farm Burger and enjoyed hers a bit more since I love eggs.\\n\\nThe Truffle Parmesan Fries seemed okay to me. Most flavor came from the sauces served with the fries, which were good. But I didn't think the fries were anything spectacular.\\n\\nPerhaps I had higher expectations because of all the other reviews. I really wanted to love it but I just was not blown away. At least I can say I tried it! It was an overall good experience though. Just not sure if I want to pay $15 for a burger again.\",\n",

       " 'haoamammmmmmmm I\\'ve been wanting to try BurGR ever since they opened and I was ecstatic to have a chance to this weekend!  The fire decor on the exterior of the restaurant is definitely eye catching!  Their seating service was convenient, in that we notified the the host, and they wrote down our number, giving us an ETA and a text of when our table would be available.  Skipping the line waiting was the best feeling ever!  Wasn\\'t too hard to pass time as the surrounding area of Planet Hollywood is filled with shops and gambling!  \\n\\nWhen we were notified of seating, I was relived to be seated in a very \"relaxing\" environment. With no actual line queue for the restaurant, I feel that everyone was relived, and there was no rushed eating/squished dining quarters to accommodate demanding hungry diners!  Since my group ordered a lot of appetizers, we all split a burger between 2 people, which went perfectly!  \\n\\nJalapeno poppers were great and fun, in that of the 6 served, 1 was extra spicy!  Truffle fries and sweet potato fries were also delicious accompaniments.  you definitely have to try the MILKSHAKES!! I believe it was #4, but there was creme brullee and cookies and cream.  It was a heavenly experience.  The handful of sips i stole off my cousin were amazing.    \\n\\nBURGERS ARE PERFECT YES.  They are cooked exactly how youd want them, whether it be med rare, med etc!! and you can tell they use good beef.  It was unlike any other burger I\\'ve ever had, nice and hearty mmm.  Next time I want to try the farm burger!  Pricing is very reasonable, ~15/16 per burger.  Compared to Umami Burger, Gordon Ramsay is completely worth it.  The burger sizes are larger, and the tastes are still amazing.',\n",
       " \"Exterior = 5/5: located inside of Planet Hollywood near one of the entrances of the casino, we got lost trying to find it since it looked like it was in Paris Paris on the GPS. The exterior has a really cool fire wall which grabs your attention almost immediately. \\n\\nInterior = 4/5: it was a nice setting, clean and modern feel. Location is a little on the small side. Choices between booth, tables, bar, or high chair seating. Downside was there is no bathroom inside of the restaurant, however it is right outside in the casino across from the entrance. Noise level was nice even for being in the casino, didn't really notice the entrance or casino the restaurant is between.\\n\\nService = 5/5: no complaints on food service. Seating took a while so be ready to wait outside in a line. \\n\\nOrder = 4/5\\nTruffle fries: good for the first couple pieces then kind of got tired of it. Did offer two different sauces for dipping, one was similar to marinara and the other was aoili. Barely tasted the truffle felt like the garlic over powered the truffle.\\n\\nOreo with creme brulee pudding: the concept of the milkshake with pudding was really interesting, it was a good complement to the burgers. Oreo tasted yummy, similar to other milkshakes I have had. But it was unique was the pudding and ice cream combo.\\n\\nCoffee with chocolate pudding: same comment, unique factor was the pudding on top which gave a nice texture difference between the two desserts. The coffee milkshake tasted like a Hagen daz milkshake, not complaining but I wasn't floored. \\n\\nHell's Kitchen Burger: boyfriend ordered this burger and be warned it is spicy because of the pepper inside. If you get bits of it, the spice is manageable but still a little on the spicy side. This is coming from someone who handles spice, so get this burger if you like spice or can handle it. Cooked exactly to what we wanted which was medium rare. \\n\\nFarm Burger: I love burgers with egg. This burger had egg. Egg wasn't overcooked so that made me enjoy it more. There was also a nice piece of duck bacon to add a bit more saltiness to the burger's flavor. Cooked perfectly to medium rare, something I like to call out since places don't always do that.\\n\\nOverall = 4.5/5\\n\\nHint = burgers look small, but fill you up pretty well. I found myself in a crazy food coma after this meal. They don't offer text notifications like other places, you have to wait in line to be brought into the restaurant for seating, no seating either.\",\n",

We finally got around to it and I was a bit disappointed.\\n\\nIt was hard to choose whether to give this place 4 stars or 3. I went with 3 for a few reasons.  When we were finally towards the front of the line, a couple in front of us returned to the front.  They told us that they were going to be seated next to the fire and it was way too hot. So the hostess said \"next 2!\" (which was us) and ran off.  When we didn\\'t follow her, she turned around and gave us the rudest glare.  If she didn\\'t run off she would have heard us try to tell her that we would rather not sit next to a fire.  Vegas already feels like fire 24/7, who wants to be even hotter?  Her attitude was such a turn off and put me in a bad mood.\\n\\nWe proceeded to get sat a few minutes later. After almost 10 minutes of sitting there without being greeted, I started to look around.  We weren\\'t the only ones who were clearly ready to order and didn\\'t even have drinks.  Maybe they should put more people on the floor??\\n\\nWe ordered the jalapeno poppers $12.  They were good.  I really liked the cheddar ranch dipping sauce.  I ordered the Farm burger $15 (duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg).  It was delicious although a tad overcooked.  I also ordered the truffle parmesan fries. Sooo good!! BUT they were undercooked.  I thought they would be hot and crisp, instead they were soggy.  What a disappointment for $11.  There\\'s plenty of places that sell truffle parmesan fries for $4... Although the flavor of these were by far my favorite.  I loved the truffle aioli that came with it.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the fries (especially how good they would be if they were cooked right).  My bf ordered the hell\\'s kitchen burger $14, which he liked.  But he said he should have added a fried egg and bacon on it.  For drinks we got a blue moon $7 and a cocktail $11.  I can\\'t remember what the cocktail was called.  Although it was tasty, it was literally a mike\\'s hard with a shot of whiskey. \\n\\nService was okay. It\\'s a \"take your order and drop the check\" kind of restaurant... \\n\\nWould I return? Not sure. If I did I would skip the drinks and the appetizer. For an appetizer, two burgers, a fry, and two drinks our bill was $80.  Very pricey for an okay experience.  \\n\\nOh! Also, we were told it would be a 45 min wait, it only took 20 min to get seated. Maybe the 45 min included the time it took our server to greet us and have someone bring drinks. Also, we were not offered the \"we will text you when your table is ready\" option.',\n",

They said it was a 30 minute wait and asked for our number so they could call us when a table was ready.  This was great as we could walk around the casino until then. A mere 15 minutes later we got the call and were seated.  Our waiter was pleasant and efficient throughout the meal but we had to wait at the table quite a while to get our food. Two of us ordered burgers and the third ordered a salad. I ordered the \"Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger\" which was excellent. The meat was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  The other member of our party ordered a simple burger w/ cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc.  He had the same remark as I did about the patty but said that the cheese was extremely salty.  The third member of our party said the salad was very good.  They said their salad was \"very good.\"  We ordered a side of truffle fries to split among the three of us. The homemade ketchup and aioli dipping sauces were amazing! Overall a good experience.',\n",

Are you Kidding me? Yay for me! I\\'m gonna grab a burger! \\nI opted for more casual dining and sat at the sport bar with the overhead high-definition TVs and the loud blasting music, The bartender was great and the service was  outstanding, the decor is very interesting and hot, and the ambiance is lively and modern. I\\'d expect nothing less from Ramsey\\n\\nI ordered a basic burger- American Burger! \\nSolid burger, made to my preference, with sweet lettuce, ripe tomato, fresh onion and sweet-bitter pickle with good american cheese on \"baked in-house\" bun, but it still wasn\\'t memorable.

The best sauce was the curry ketchup! I would recommend this highly on a burger. Seriously worst service. I would go back. Sat there over an hour never got a refill on drinks. Then a server was non existent. When we asked another refill from a different server he looked at us an turned away then finally someone came.  As a chef myself food is a major part of the experience but the service seals the deal. Don't forget the customer service.\",\n",

Thankfully we were able to skip the line and be seated right away. The server was nice, but unfortunately, the food took nearly an hour to arrive. Despite being a Saturday, the restaurant didn\\'t seem packed, so the wait was unacceptable. Our server, while nice, never stopped to say, \"sorry about the wait\" or \"your food should be out in a few minutes.\"  My husband got the farm burger. He was pleased. I got the Caesar salad and the gooey fries. The gooey fries had definitely been sitting out because they were not hot and the cheese no longer gooey. Big disappointment. My Caesar was good, but not exceptional for Gordon Ramsey. Overall, negative for the long wait and prices and positive for  while the atmosphere and kind servers.  Will only go back for the milkshakes which we had the first time. SO good.',\n",

The buns used were too tall making it difficult to eat, and I wasn't a fan of the balance of the burger either.  I had the farm burger (16) and the white truffle fries (11) and a soda (4).  The fries were decent, much better than the plain fries, while the sweet potato fries were a bit too sweet really.  The fries are advertised as big enough to share, but honestly we had a table of 9 people who don't eat that much and we really needed 6 because we finished 5 sets without wasting a breath.  If you have a reasonable appetite you might want to order one just for yourself.\\n\\nSo yeah not a bad burger, but for $31 + tax + tip for a burger/fries/soda combo I'd expect much better.

The shake was our favorite of the whole brunch experience! You can taste a little bit of toffee crystal pieces in the shake along with the well-blended oreo shake. The fries were thick-cut fries! I wished they were thin and crispy, then that would be mindblowing. We added bacon to their original American burger. Was it a good burger?? Yah but no wow factor. The standard dawg was indeed standard with the typical pickles, ketchup, mustard and hot dog. The bun, however, was full with toasted black sesame seeds. The wow factor here was how big the dawg was...

Cows who willingly provide magical milk for the shakes and give their lives to create the greatest hamburgers ever made.  It's the only explanation I can come up with.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of the Gordon Ramsay 'Hell's Kitchen' show like many who frequent BurGR are.  I've seen maybe two episodes at best.  So when people started pointing at the executive chef, I had to Google her from the name embroidered on her chef's uniform.  Turns out she won Season Ten.  I didn't care, but that's kind of interesting.  But not as interesting as my meal.\\n\\nI normally wouldn't wait in line 30 minutes for a meal at a burger joint, but I was dining alone and there was a very short wait to eat at the counter. I'd heard good things so it seemed an ideal opportunity to try it out.  Next time I'm in town, I'll happily wait 30 minutes, an hour or however long it takes because it's well worth the wait. \\n\\nThe menu includes some selection of appetizers (onion rings looked amazing) and a selection of about ten burgers.  They had salads and some other stuff, but really why bother?  There is a fancy hot dog that seemed popular, but I was focused on getting one of these famous burgers I have heard about.\\n\\nBurgers ranged from the good old American Burger (my choice, a plain cheeseburger the way those magical cows probably intended) to other interesting combinations. One of the specialty burgers involved duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  It's that kind of place.  My burger and the bun were terrific.  It's not cheap ($13 for burger alone) but worth it.  Burgers are  cooked over an apple wood fire or something, which I guess actually makes a difference?  Or it's just the magical cows again. \\n\\nFries include sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and 'just fries' - had the regular fries and the chipotle and curry ketchups were available as well.  Amazing.  Add $9.\\n\\nFinally, the milkshakes - ranging from creme brulee (my runner up - next time) to coconut to caramel pudding and more.  I chose 'Shake #3' which included a banana milkshake covered in butterscotch pudding and topped with a snickerdoodle cookie.  It was SOOOOOO good it has at the very least tied the Twinkie shake at BLT Burger for best shake ever.  I may need to conduct a side-by-side taste test next time I'm in town.  Add another $9.  Yes, $9 for a shake.  Worth every penny.\\n\\nThe ambiance is great and, if you are into the whole 'celebrity chef' thing, you'll love it even more.  Service was prompt and super-friendly, and the food, as I said, is wonderful.  It's the magical cows.  \\n\\nThe whole meal, just a burger, fries and milkshake, came to about $40 with tip.  Yes, $40 for a basic burger and fries.  Again repeat after me. . . . worth. every. penny.\\n\\nKudos, Gordon Ramsay.  I didn't think I'd every pay that kind of money for a burger.  But I did, and I will again.  When you visit your magical farm please tell the cows I thank them for their service!\",\n",

I had the perfect amount of yolk for dipping. I also got the Parmesan truffle fries, the portion was huge and they were perfection. And to end my meal, I had heaven in a glass. The chocolate milkshake is divine. Chocolate shake topped with caramel pudding and a toffee cookie. Super creamy shake, tastes like a chocolate explosion in your mouth.

I can't even begin to tell you how good it was. Perfectly cooked and all the flavors went together amazingly. Had the truffle fries to go with it. The catsup was out of this world good. Also had the wings, can't remember the name of them but we called them Chicken lollipops. Not like any other wing I've ever had. There is a secret Burgr not on the menu.

We finally get our burgers about 10 minutes later and they are luke warm and the meat over cooked. When I asked the waitress about our regular fry order she just smiled and said, oh I may have left that off of the order.  I expected so much more. The skirts on the waitresses leave very little to the imagination.. Maybe that is to distract you from the slow service and mediocre burger. Wont spend $60 on burgers at this place again.

The bread was very moist and toasted to perfection. It almost seems like each bread was baked or taken out of the oven when a sandwich is ordered. I love bread and I loved the bread on my sandwich  and it made my sandwich tasted so much better. Amy ordered a turkey burger. I love the cranberry sauce that was on it. Lee ordered I believe the Ramsay's burger. It was OK. Ekka also ordered a fish sandwich. All the burgers were huge, more than enough for one person. We also ordered alfredo fries and another fries. I liked the alfredo fries. It was new to me and very rich, almost like eating alfredo pasta. I gave it a 4 star just because they made us waited even though there were empty tables and we were very hot with 2 infants with us.

       " \"Hungry and winning in Las Vegas, I knew I had to find food. After seeing a fellow yelper's review about this place (Hi Jacqueline R), I knew I had to try it out but I didn't expect to be in love!!! Located inside Planet Hollywood, we walked in to find a long line standing next to the restaurants name in flames of fire! Exciting!!! We waited a few minutes before being seated. The place has a nice feel to it without being too overwhelming. It's very modern and spacious. It gets even more modern once you get to place your order, which is placed thanks to an Ipad.. yes you read that right, on an Ipad!! So cool. \\n\\nOur waiter came over and gave us a brief rundown on highlighted menu items. While scrolling through the menu we decided we would share our meal.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n*Truffle Parmesan Fries $11- HIGHLY recommended! Crisp, tasty, not oily at all. The truffle salt and parmesan, the amazing taste of these fries truly blew me away.  Outstanding! Some of the best fries ever! And for sure hard to share since I totally wanted to eat the whole thing myself. I love that the cheese was evenly spread out through out the whole cone of fries, which allowed us to get our fair share of cheese with each bite. The dipping sauce/truffle aioli was also pretty tasty.   (10/10)\\n\\n*Euro Burger $16- Juicy meat, warm soft delicious bread bun, truffle aioli running down my fingers making me lick the goodness off, some goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and arugula for some greens. Goodness gracious! The quality of this burger is so worth the dollars I spent to get to this burger bliss. The burger was a decent size, I would have been wayyyy full if I ate it all myself but we were pretty satisfied with the portion and decided to leave some room in for more alcohol.  (10/10)\\n\\n*Green tea gin- STRONG flavor of gin in this drink indeed! Had a good buzz going on thanks to this baby. The green tea flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.   (9/10)\\n\\nWe were gonna try a shake or the interesting push pops that we saw some people sharing from across our table but they said it wasn't anything too special or highly recommended so we decided to skip out on dessert. \\n\\nThere is a professional photographer that comes around and takes pictures of you during your meal which made me feel like a celebrity haha. We decided to not purchase the picture. I thought it was interesting that they offered this service but the photographer himself was very nice and easy going. The customer service of Burgr is truly up to standards. They know how to treat their customers well. They for sure make them feel special and walk out with a happy belly and pretty smile. Would love to come back and get me another burger (maybe the hell's kitchen burger with the jalapeno for the spice and some avocado slices or brittania burger that sounded interesting with mango chutney and sharp cheddar cheese) and my own side of fries to make any Vegas vacation trip an incredible one in my book. Everything I tried here was well worth the price!\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had this review in my drafts for quite a while, but wrote a note to myself as a reminder of my impression. \"It was alright.\" So there you have it, my three word review for Gordan Ramsay BurGR. \\n\\nLonger review here:\\n\\nBf & I went to Vegas over summer, and we were both determined to check out BurGR despite the long lines. I had recently seen a friend\\'s IG pic of the Farm Burger, and since he raved about it, I wanted to try it out for myself. Besides, one of the best part about Vegas is trying good food, so why not?\\n\\nWe came on a weekday night and waited in line for about 45 minutes. We both ordered the Farm Burger [$15] (duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + fried egg) and truffle parmesan fries [$11] to share. I went with the farm burger because: 1. Seemed to be the most popular item based on Yelp pics, 2. Oooo duck bacon?! = must try, 3. Server recommendation. \\n\\nNow, for all the hype about this place, I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed and disappointed with my experience. Three points to highlight:\\n\\n1) Service was awful. Does it always take over half an hour for the food to  come out??? (including our appetizer, the fries) After waiting in line for close to an hour, hunger level was approaching hangy-ness. After ordering, I was expecting to get the food and start eating in maybe 10 to 20 minutes tops. At the half hour mark, we asked our server, and she claimed it was the norm for food to take this long. However, the tables seated nearby who came in AFTER us already got their food. And besides, couldn\\'t they at least bring out the fries?\\n\\n2) Food was meh. Maybe it was because they kept me waiting so long, so the anticipation/expectation were at an all-time high. But my burger didn\\'t really WOW me. I mean it was good, don\\'t get me wrong. Just a tad too salty for my taste. The fried egg was a nice touch, though. Fries were not bad. Curious about the curry ketchup that comes with reg fries, so if I return, will def try it out.\\n\\n3) Presentation was great. Although I was underwhelmed with everything, I loved the small details about this restaurant. The fire display at the entrance that enthralls you every time you walk by (and a perfect photo opp!). The menu with a photo of Chef Gordan Ramsay himself, which makes an nice keepsake. The way the food was presented, which makes eating (and taking pictures of it) more enjoyable if I must admit.\\n\\nAll in all, I will admit my first experience with Gordan Ramsay BurGR was a tad underwhelming. Even though it was very exciting to eat at my first Ramsay restaurant, the food (and mainly the long wait) was disappointing. Can\\'t say for sure if I will be back, but if I am and my opinion changes, I will def write an updated review.',\n",

       " '\"Bloody hell! You can\\'t even cook a burger properly!\"\\n After a visit to BurGR, I have lost so much respect for the hardball, no BS when it comes to food and service celebrity Chef Ramsey. BurGR at Planet Hollywood was actually quite a joke. I can\\'t believe Chef would put his name on an establishment that has less than stellar service, BIG problems in the kitchen, rundown décor, and honestly marginal food.  \\n\\nThe joint: No reservations, so be prepared to wait in line. It appeared long; however, moved quickly. The restaurant space is jam packed with tables (seriously...elbow room only), so tables steadily open up. BurGR is \"well worn.\"  I can understand a little wear and tear here and there, but the placemats were tattered, cloth napkins were faded, plates had half of what used to be the BurGr logo on them, and the painted floors were worn down to the concrete in several areas...definitely in need of a face lift. \\n\\nNow onto THE important part - the FOOD:\\nHusband had the Farm Burger with Duck Breast Bacon, sharp English cheddar cheese, topped with a soft fried egg. \\nI ordered the Euro Burger with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes. \\nSide order of \"Just Fries\" served in a large metal cone with curry and chipotle ketchups. \\n\\nWhere to start? Food was delivered...\"stone cold.\" Hubby\\'s burger had died in the window, glaringly obvious by the congealed cheddar cheese and hard cooked ice cold (like cold from the fridge) egg. Mine burger was room temp at best. And, despite the fact that we each ordered different cook temps on our burgers (medium and med-well, respectively) they both arrived well-done.  We informed the waitperson (very lovely gal) and she offered to re-order. We were already an hour and a half in and had plans so we declined.  \\n\\nThe General Manager, Joana Holtey, came to our table - offered a re-order...again \"no thanks.\" She was very apologetic. Thirty seconds later Joana returned with another egg on a plate...that was COLD. Haha Obviously, they are precooking eggs in the kitchen. Ridiculous! Two minutes later Joana delivered a perfectly cooked fresh egg...by then half the burger had been eaten.  Two comp beers to go and the offer to return and give another comp try were much appreciated, but sadly the damage had already been done and we had other plans for the rest of the week. \\n\\nI think it\\'s important to note that BurGR might have been having a particularly bad night. Prior to us ordering, we had a conversation with the couple sitting next to us about the issues they had with the Farm Burger - same over-cooked, cold egg. They sent theirs back 3 times and eventually just left without eating. Two people sitting behind us, three people sitting to the left us, and one person at the table in front of us all sent plates back. Wowza! And, that\\'s just what we noticed in our little area of the restaurant. Not good Gordie! Not good at all! I\\'m going to heed the same order you so often give during \"Hell\\'s Kitchen\" and tell myself to \"F*&^ OFF!\"...only this person won\\'t be coming back. So disappointed.\\n\\nOh, I almost forgot - there was a person walking around the restaurant offering to take group photos for sale. Really?! Tacky!',\n",
       " 'All I have to say is \"wow!\"  Beyond amazing burgers and fries.  We tired all 3 types of fries and each of us had a different burger. Yum.  Had to wait 30 minutes to get in but totally worth it.',\n",
       " \"I was lucky enough to not have to wait in the long line at BurGr because I was by myself and sat at the bar.  I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was awesome.  Very well cooked and the flavors were great.  I also ordered a side of fries and they were good but definitely meant for two people to share.\\n\\nGreat burger but if I had to wait in the line I'd probably pick another place to eat.\",\n",
       " \"Probably my absolute favorite restaurant on the Strip! Whenever I have friends coming into town, I always make sure to bring them to BurGR. It's the perfect Vegas restaurant for tourists! It's not too pricey, the burger is filling, and GORDON RAMSAY!\\n\\nIs it lame to have everyone in your party order the same thing? It's okay if you all get the Farm Burger. \\n\\nThe Farm Burger is a solid 5 out of 5. After trying some of the other burgers, the Farm definitely tops the list. Whoever thought of adding duck bacon into the mix is a genius! The fried egg already adds a kick to your palette but adding those bacon strips puts you to the edge. \\n\\nTheir Sweet Potato Fries is also pretty good! They serve it with two different sauces and sprinkle powdered sugar on top. Nice touch. \\n\\nNow, it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant so keep in mind that there may be a line. Try to come before the lunch/dinner rush to get seated quickly! They're pretty good with turning their tables so even then, waiting isn't too bad. If the hostess asks you if sitting at the bar is okay, say yes! You get a good view of where the magic happens so why not?!\",\n",
       " \"Yum. The first time we tried to go here there was like an hour wait. No thanks. But the second time was around 11a or 12p and we got in no problem. The waitress outfits were a lil Star Trek hooch, but the guys got to wear cute GR jeans and some shirts. Shade. But our waiter was a cutie. Anyway, I got the American burger and split some Parmesan truffle fries with my friend. The sauce was interesting and the fries were good. The ketchup was definitely housemade and it was ok, but there was some stronger flavor in it like horseradish or something that I wasn't all that fond of. But my burger was perfectly done (med well), seasoned perfectly and had a nice little char on it. It was pretty big so a couple of us couldn't finish the burger in one sitting. It made for a great room temp late night drunken munchie snack though (we didn't have fridges in our room at PH, so if you get food poisoning from lack of refrigeration don't blame me). Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy the food. Love my Gordon.\",\n",

I got my water right away and they were always around to refill it. When we ordered our food, I loved that our waiter said we could have our fries come out before our burgers did, which I was so happy about because I came hungry. We ordered the Parmesan truffle fries which I really liked and a side of Maui onion rings, which I also recommend trying. Both are unique and you won't be disappointed with your order. The portions are definitely big enough to share, so keep that in mind. I ordered the American burger, which I also really liked. Everything about it was really good, there isn't anything I would have changed. I definitely want to go back and try the desserts, since I was too full to try it this time around.

Especially considering how busy this place is and how new it is. They really have their act together.\\n\\nI ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The burger I have to say was just ok. I didn't like the meat, it was a little dry and had sort of a strange taste (maybe the fancy wood it's grilled on?), I ordered it medium.  Like I wish it was fattier or something... Then considering it had duck bacon and a fried egg and aioli on it all i could taste was the meat. I think I just prefer not grilled burgers to be honest.

The figgy onion jam gave it a really nice sweetness but nothing overpowering. I much preferred this burger to my Holsteins burger. \\n\\nThe truffle fries....oh the truffle fries.  So good I couldn't stop eating them, with the truffle aioli. I was so full but just kept picking at them because they were so good.\\n\\nHusband liked his but preferred Holsteins burger.

Went to it on Saturday night with no reservations and waited about 20 minutes for 2 people which isn't so bad. \\nHad a good waiter, all the staff were very cool. \\nMy sister ordered the five spice chicken sliders and of course i had to try a burger. Chose the Chanterelle burger with mushrooms arugula  and figgy onion jam. Also got 2 sides... Fried and onion rings. \\nThe sauces and ketchup for the sides weren't the greatest. All of them had some sort of different spice that wasn't appealing. One was spicy. Not something i wanted to dip my fries into. The portions were really big! There were 2 of and we couldn't finish the rings and friends. \\nDisappointed at the shake menu. Only about 5 to choose from. \\nOverall it was a good experience for our first time there. I do look forward to going back and trying nee items.\",\n",
       " 'Where do I begin?\\n\\nTHE M*THER F#CKING CURSING: Let\\'s start at the end. As hubby and I were waiting for our check to be picked up (shortest wait of the evening), I thought I heard someone doing some serious cursing. \"What the f#ck is wrong with you?\" \"I\\'m not going to have this sh*t!\" \"I don\\'t wanna see f$cking gouda!\" Of course I ceased all conversation and listened to what turned out to be the chef berate his kitchen staff for a solid 10 minutes. And let me be clear, it was loud. And he did not hold any words back. And it went on and on and on. I don\\'t watch Hells Kitchen, but I know that in America, Ramsey is known for his temper (on his reality show). I just never expected to witness a bit of Hell\\'s Kitchen during a lovely dinner.  One employee commented that this was Chef having a \"good night.\" Yikes. \\n\\nI\\'m of two minds about this. On the one hand, some customers will enjoy the TV volatility on display.  People drawn to the restaurant because of its owner\\'s short fuse might relish in the aggressive outburst. I mean, it\\'s Vegas. People want to see a show, right? On the other hand, that kind of energy-sucking behavior is confusing and off-putting for others.\\n\\nPut me squarely in the \"off-putting\" camp. I cannot believe how aggressively and loudly the chef went at his employees. If it had not gone on, I would have assumed it was a customer or that I had misheard. But he didn\\'t care if we heard. And I think that\\'s my issue. Not only was it unprofessional, but it unnerved me a and put and let me on edge at the end of my meal. And no one seemed to care about the effect of the outburst on guests. There are establishments where rough language and behavior are expected and even appreciated. A high-end burGR joint in a casino on the strip isn\\'t one. If Chef was yelling in the back somewhere out of earshot, no one would be the wiser. Heck, if he had shouted a few curse words, only a few patrons at the counter would have known. But to draw an entire section of the restaurant into his tantrum was too much.  \\n\\nTHE REST\\n\\nTHE OUTFITS: Why do the male servers wear loose jeans and loose gray tops while the women wear skin-tight (read \\'two-sizes too small\\'), short (read \\'I almost saw her lady business\\') chest baring outfits? Before a barrage of foul language disputed my meal, I was blown away at the attire in this establishment. I don\\'t think you have to be a feminist to be offended at the objectification of the women who serve food at BurGR. I saw each lady tug at the front of her dress no less than two times. It\\'s ridiculous.  I know sex (or the promise of it) is driving the wardrobe decisions here, but loosening the dresses one size and lengthening them 2 inches might allow the ladies to still look sexy (God forbid they don\\'t) without worrying about flashing the restaurant.  Unlike the hostesses (whose outfits were slightly looser), the servers have to bend and pull and lean and stretch. Their job requires constant movement. Why can\\'t they wear \"sexy\" clothing that accommodates that? \\n\\nTHE WAIT: Sigh, it\\'s not shocking to wait to be seated at a restaurant on the strip. We waited to be seated. We waited to see a server. We waited for our refills. We asked for refills and waited some more. Just be ready to wait at BurGR.  We didn\\'t see one customer getting a refill on any beverage. After asking a second time for a refill, the busboy (also in an unnecessarily tight top) brought over new glasses. He set them down and then collected the original glasses. We laughed because they obviously don\\'t expect to refill drinks at BurGR. In fairness, it was a busy night. But on the flip side, it was a busy night---be ready to serve water to your patrons.  I wonder if Chef was yelling about that.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE: The staff was helpful and kind. \\n\\nTHE FOOD: The truffle fries were warmish (was that it Chef?) and flavorful. Many places in town do a variation on this theme and none of them have been that impressive to me. My Euro burger was flavorful and was cooked perfectly. I appreciate the quality buttered and toasted bun as well. Hubby LOVED the Farm burger. And after tasting it, I had to agree that it was the standout.\\n\\nOVERALL: This was a three and a half star review before the outburst. I didn\\'t taste (or experience) anything that would entice me to hop in my car, drive around for a spot, walk through the maze that is Planet Hollywood, and wait for an inordinate amount of time for a table in a hamburger joint. BurGR is not for me.\\n\\nBUT, this is a great spot for tourists. It is located in a convenient area near Las Vegas BLVD, so those walking around can stop in easily and have a bite. It\\'s easy to access and the food is good. And what does a tourist care about a wait or obscene language or an impractically tight dress? This is VEGAS. What I see as problems would very likely bring tourists back time and time again.',\n",

Despite waiting almost two hours to get seated, we had to wait another hour for the food to arrive at our table. Don't get me wrong our waitress was really sweet and brought our drinks in no time. But we waited a long time to get our food. I ordered a Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was amazing the meat was cooked just how I liked it. Apart from the burger we ordered Parmesan fries, according to the recent reviews the fries were amazing but ours not so much. The fries we received were kind of cold and tasted old. Overall I would eat her again but next time make a reservation in advance, and get jalapeño poppers instead.\",\n",
       " \"The food is pretty good, especially the burgers. I haven't tried the faro salad but saw a table next to me order it and it looked amazing. \\n\\nI give this place 2 stars because the hostesses and most of the staff in general are a bunch of assholes. We came here 2 nights in a row and thought we would have better luck the second time but that wasn't the case. We sat at the bar near the entrance and ordered an american burger and asked to swap the lettuce for arugula and the bartender was complete asshole about that. As if it were taking soo much of his precious time to actually use the computer and input the switch. Like it's not that hard to do. Everyone here just has a really terrible fucking attitude and it's really annoying! The servers are pretty decent though, so I'm mostly referencing to the bartenders (at least the blonde guy wearing glasses) and the hostesses. The hostesses are fucking shit. I want to punch them in the face. They are so stupid and act like their job is so difficult. They have shitty attitudes and try to talk down to everyone like they're so much better or something. GTFO. \\nSo yea the customer service here is fucking terrible. If you don't care about that and just want to eat a burger then go for it. But if you're looking for an experience and good customer service  then this isn't the place. \\nAlso yesterday we spoke with the manager Nicky about her hostesses attitude problems and she said she understood and has had several complaints and is working on training them better but after coming back second time I think that there is more to the problem than management can handle. I also think that not all the managers are on the same page so there's a lot of mess going on. I was expecting so much more from being a restaurant of Ramsey. I know he himself can be an asshole but I think that's how it goes as a chef and was not expecting g the same shitty attitude from the staff. I hope they figure it out or change their staff!\",\n",

Although, we shouldn\\'t be imagining much because this is a restaurant and not a trashy strip club... right?\\n\\nOnto the food:\\n- Truffle fries - delicious, they are cut thick and come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside\\n- Jalapeno poppers - they arrive upright on a stand with individual shot cup dippers.  Each popper is filled with cheddar bacon.  Be careful, one of them has all of the seeds! \\n- Sliders - literally 2 so that it can earn that plural S on the end.  They were okay... save your stomach for the real burgers\\n- Onion Rings - probably some of the best I\\'ve had in quite some time.\\n\\nNow the burgers... recommend you order a few and cut em up to share:\\n- Chanterelle Burger - with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula and a sweet figgy-onion jam. Phenomenal.\\n- Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger - with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato.  This one was bland and boring in comparison to the Chanterelle.  Being that it earned the title of \"Hell\\'s Kitchen\" I was expecting more fire... more oomph, but turns out it was just a typical boring burger with a fancy avocado.

       " \"My wife and I went here twice for dessert while we were in Vegas for my conference.  On a previous trip, we came here for lunch, but it was dessert only during this trip.  I guess we were creatures of habit, as we got the same thing for dessert both times we came, mainly because it was flat out fantastic.  I posted a picture of our dessert for anyone that wants to see.  We each got a shake.  They're truly unique shakes in that they're part pudding and part ice cream shake.  I ordered the crème brulee pudding and cookies and cream shake, while my wife got the chocolate pudding and coffee ice cream shake.    They're pretty large shakes, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The shakes are $8 a piece, so they're not cheap, but totally worth it.  If you come here, be sure to save room for dessert.  One other thing to note, the seating at and around the bar is first come first serve.  So, you don't have to wait in the long line to get a seat.  We avoided what looked like a long line by doing this both times.  You can even order from the full menu in this area.\",\n",

The whole place seemed a lot like what we watched on television of Hell\\'s Kitchen. The sign, \"BURGR GORDON RAMSEY,\" was made of glass with the inside lit with real fire. It was a sight to see! \\n\\nMy bf and I decided to eat here on the second day we arrived in Vegas which was smacked on a Friday. Everywhere was packed with people going to eat, shopping and nightclubs. The restaurant was a full house but the wait wasn\\'t long. There were two options for the waiting: one was to put your name on an iPad and put down how big or small is your party and they will call you when the table is ready or you can wait in the line which wasn\\'t bad because we waited for about 15 minutes and we got seated. \\n\\nUpon being seated and looking at the menu (which is quite small and gets to the point of what burger was most recommended, it was really easy to choose). My bf got the Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger while I got the Farm Burger. We also got the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Fries do not come with the burgers. Waiting for the food took roughly 30-45 minutes but my bf said it was worth it and he never says anything is worth it until this place.

I was a bit sceptical since I dislike chefs who are on TV longer that inside a kitchen but I had to swallow my skepticism together with the delicious burger I had.\\nThe Euro burger, with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomatoes was out-of-this-world good; so was the Hell\\'s Kitchen burger with asadero cheese, jalapeño and avocado; portions were perfect and prices average for Vegas Strip but low if you consider the quality of the burger (and the fact that the restaurant\\'s has a famous chef\\'s name in it - that\\'s mainly what raises the prices around here)\\nThe location inside the PH casino is not really the nicest you might expect, I thought it was going to be noisy but it wasn\\'t as noisy as I thought it would be. The furniture that resembles a cafeteria or a hotel restaurant (there were also a couple of screens showing sports) gives it a kind of relaxed atmosphere and not that of a fancy gourmet burger place.\\nI had other great burgers in Vegas (Stripburger, I *heart* burgers, etc.) but this one had that extra something.

       " 'I was here a few months back so I hope this isn\\'t too outdated, I just lost track of time lol. For those who follow me...\\n*Gluten free note* \\nI\\'m still surprised how little this is mentioned. Anyway, when I was there the menu was a bit confusing because it listed only 1 burger as gluten free, but the waiter was knowledgeable and pointed out that all of their burgers can be made gluten free upon request. Of course, keep away from obvious things (I\\'m looking at you crispy onions) but they do seem to have a better handle than most on this. \\nGluten bias point: +.5 (I add this to the total averaged from the scores below!) \\n\\nFood: 4 - everything was REALLY rich. It was like upscale bar food honestly, very Vegas-y\\nAmbience: 3.5 - I\\'m torn on this, the really high bar stools didn\\'t do it for me, nor did the upscale hooter girls. Sorry people, it\\'s subjective lol\\nService: 4 - My waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and slow. Points knocked for the loudly gossiping hostesses/waitresses, they weren\\'t friendly. \\nPrice: 4 - not as bad as I thought it would be for the name\\n\\nOk so the long review :) \\n\\nFood: Alright, so I really loved some of the upscale aspects like duck egg, duck bacon, gouda etc. Some of those small elements really pushed my score up. I was disappointed by how unbalanced the food tasted. Honestly, it was really greasy, really rich, and needed salt. I did love the cheesy fries with the duck egg, and the yolk kind of helped eat the super cheesy fries but I couldn\\'t eat more than a couple bites. I had to get my burger protein-style of course, and I got the egg there too. Although the meat was cooked perfectly, and really moist, it didn\\'t have very flavor on its own. I mean, basic salt and pepper yanno? It was ..just higher quality burger meat. I have to say Gordon\\'s name really sets your expectations pretty high, so that\\'s probably where the disappointment came in. But, I really like duck. \\n\\nBut I mean if you\\'re looking to eat fattening, rich, and greasy bar-food with an upscale feel, this is your joint. \\n\\nAmbience: I hated the high bar stools, so probably would do the table next time. The fire was definitely cool though. I had a hard time grading this, honestly, it\\'s probably the detached girls that did it in for me but I tried to factor them more into the service than the ambience. I will say that the way they dress is fair game for \"ambience\" and you get the feel of a kind of upper-class hooters. I have no idea what they did though because there was like 6 girls at the front with 1 or 2 ever leaving and all they did was talk. It was really annoying. The vibe was a guy-vibe. I might get heat for this (bring on the insults about my insecurity and religion) but it just wasn\\'t for me. I usually don\\'t even mind bars/pubs that are clearly not trying to be anything other than a bar/pub but this place felt like it was both trying too hard and not hard enough lol\\n\\nService: My waiter was nice, cordial but nice. He was informed about gluten so I did like that. I really did not like the snobby feel I got from pretty much everyone there. It wasn\\'t welcoming at all. The girls at the front were loudly gossiping, they hardly acknowledged us, and it\\'s very anti-feminist of me to say but it really felt like they expected their looks to do all the talking. I wanted a smile, a welcome, something kind lol \\n\\nPrice: Honestly, I expected to pay more. I think what makes this expensive is because they\\'re not \"meals\" like everything is separate, which is kind of genius honestly. So you price the burger at around $15 but make them buy everything else on the side haha. I was both impressed and annoyed that I fell for it. No, but really, aside from my greasy/rich/fatty complaint, the food really was different enough to warrant the price. I really like duck too.',\n",

The burger we order we overcooked had to get it redone, had to track down and eventually went and got our own refills, since we never saw our waitress again.

I ended up as the third person in line and sat at the bar area.  My server was friendly, helpful, and he wasn't pushy.  He made some suggestions and I went along with it.  I had a farm burger with truffle fries and a light alcoholic pink drink.  The drink was surprising light and the burger was moist and rich.  The truffle fries however left me as disappointed.  They were overly salted but I think it was because I had one of the first servings on top with the salt but that was near the end.

My mother and I split the kale Caesar salad, which was my favorite part of the meal.  The dressing wasn't overly heavy and the apple complimented the bitterness of the kale, making it surprisingly palatable.  Even if you find kale to be the worst vegetable in the universe, which my mom and I do, you will probably enjoy this salad.  My dad and I had the farm burger, which my dad loved; I, however, did not.  The duck bacon that they put on top of the burger had a stringy consistency which made it hard to eat and activated my gag reflex.  The egg yolk had dripped all over my plate even before it made it to the table, making the bottom of an otherwise delightful bun soggy.  The burger itself was well-cooked, juicy, and flavorful.  All this combined made for an average burger.  My mom skipped the burger and ordered fish and chips instead.  I don't understand why it is served in giant sandwich roll which makes it impossible to eat unless you can unhinge your jaw.  She also said that the fish was bland and drenched it in ketchup to give it flavor.\\nThe service was good and the waitress was attentive however, she gave us the wrong drinks and then forgot to bring us water with lemon in it. \\nOverall, this was a disappointing experience and I won't be coming back anytime soon.\",\n",

However, with parties of 2, you have to stand in that looooong line. That\\'s.....different. But whatever floats their boat I guess. So we were quoted with an estimated wait time of 30 minutes. They were pretty accurate. In the meantime, we browsed around Miracle Mile Shops until we received a text from them. \\n\\nNow on to the food. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because along with our burgers, we got TWO orders of the parmesan truffle fries!!!! I definitely recommend just ordering one because the flavoring is very rich, so it may quickly get you full. For burgers we got (2) Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger, (1) Euro Burger and (1) Blue Burger. You can request how well you want your burgers to be cooked. Wow...these burgers are delicious!! Also, what I love about gourmet burger joints are they make the perfect portion.  You won\\'t get that \"oh my gosh...I feel so fat and bloated now after I just ate this big ass burger!!\" It will still leave you enough room for burgers, fries and maybe even dessert. We opted out on that...just not big dessert eaters, but those pudding pops sure looked good!! Even their shakes looked tempting.\\n\\nOnly reason why I rated 4 stars was the wait.

Staff were awesome and seemed like they genuinely care about the customers. \\n\\nSo I tried the Euro Burger and Truffle fries. I had to literally eat slow because I wanted to savor the moment! Fries were nice and crunchy outside, moist and tasty inside. The truffle sauce... Oh man, the truffle sauce! Can't get enough of that thing. It was sooo good that having only one cup was not enough. \\n\\nNow here comes the Euro Burger. Meat so juicy, sauce oh so darn good. Even the bun tasted amazing. Hands down one of the all time top 5 burgers that I tasted so far.

She never came back to our table aside from me downing my water to get attention so I could ask for some ketchup, to ask if we wanted desserts, and to drop off our check. We waited a while for our check and when she dropped it off, she didn't even bother to ask if I wanted a to go box for my fries. I understand it was busy, but she tended to the other tables in her section more frequently than our table. Yes I am a college student and I'm on spring break, and I did look the part, but don't judge me based on that and decide I won't tip well. I'm a hostess/waitress I know tipping etiquette, I fricking work for Caesar's Entertainment Horseshoe Bossier City, an affiliated casino with Planet Hollywood, a company that prides on services, yet I did not get the same treatment. I won't be dining in in the future, and I will let my friends know that this place is not college student friendly.\",\n",
       " 'I had the farm burger, great combination of creamy yolk and crispy duck great bacon over a medium well patty(my preference) and a side of truffle fries! The aioli is really delicious. They update their menu too. so the next time you check this restaurant, You may find a new burger on the menu',\n",
       " 'not too long waiting cause was 5pm, as soon as we seated our waiter, already busy with another table told us he would have take care of us in just a minute and he did! Matt was his name I think.. very knowledgeable, energetic and gave us good explanation and suggestions about the menu.. we took onion rings (I`m not a cheese lover but the parmigiano on top was a very good quality (I`m Italian so I know how a good parmigiano taste).. Burger???? I LOVED IT and finish in a second! Chanterelles mushroom were really fresh and the onion-fig jam gave that sweetness that made it delicious. and the additional breast duck bacon was a good choice.. Even the cocktails worth it a try..\\nA 6 stars place!',\n",
       " 'I always was fan of chef Ramsey Gorgon and his television shows about master cooking. Therefore, it was an honor to visit one of his restaurant and make sure how delicious can simple meal like burgers be. We ordered classic burgers and potato fries with truffles which were so delicious. The burgers were made perfectly, the taste was juicy and unbelievable. The truffles made potato fries special and have nothing to do with simple fries which are offered in every restaurant. The price was higher than average but if taking account pleasure which we got from the meals we never sorry about it. I highly recommend the restaurant to everyone who likes gourmet tasting burger!!!',\n",
       " \"Waiting 30 min to be seated on a Saturday was a pleasant surprise;but we learned very fast that we will pay for this later. After you sink into a chair, and the table comes up to your chin, drinks come promptly, and the waitress takes your order. 50 minutes later your food arrives. I mean, it's just burgers, shouldn't take 50 minutes after you place your order. The meat was good, bun soft, condiments almost non existent. (one sad little roasted tomato and a little bit of cheese, the sauce was not even noticeable) The fries were ok, if you like not very crunchy, soft, large fries. The sweet potato fries come with a vanilla custard, sou you can skip on a dessert, those were actually surprisingly good. Seriously, had better; but if you are a fan of waiting, and a huge slab of meat with little or no sides....enjoy!\",\n",

       " \"I'm a big Gordon Ramsay fan but BurGR fails to meet the high standards we've all grown so accustomed to seeing from him.\\n\\nWe stopped by for a late lunch and were given a 30 minute wait for our table. Fair enough, however an hour later we still hadn't been seated and the front desk looked like a slow moving train wreck. There were about 4 different hostesses juggling 10-20 different groups of people and none of them seemed to be communicating with one another. When the manager stepped in we spoke to them and were promptly seated.\\n\\nHighlights: The quality of ingredients and presentation were very good. All of the food looked great. The burgers and fries were decently tasty but overall not worth the jumped up prices.\\n\\nLowlights: Subpar service was the biggest disappointment. Our server was attentive at first but disappeared once our food was ordered. Each burger is made to order and you can specify the cooking temperature. All 4 of us ordered the same burger 'The American' but had different cooking preferences. They arrived with no markings as to which ones were cooked a certain way and we had to cut all of them in half to determine who's was who's. Ultimately it didn't matter as all of them were cooked well done. The only ketchup BurGR serves is made in house and is laced with a chipotle seasoning. If that isn't your thing, you won't be using any ketchup for your burger or fries.\\n\\nTry BurGR if you're a Ramsay fan or there's absolutely no wait. However the basic fare doesn't warrant the high prices.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing meal for the price! Ordered 3 items: 1) Hell's Kitchen Burger: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato; 2) Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings: parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip; and 3) fresh brewed iced tea. Servers were very attentive! I think it beats Bobby's Burger Palace.\",\n",
       " \"Sadly for my tummy, I was dining alone and didn't get to sample anyone else's food or over order. Happily, my burger was wonderful! I ordered the Farm burger that features duck bacon and a fried egg. \\n\\nBecause I'm picky about buns I'll start my review there. The bun had a great texture, not too soft, not dense, but substantial. It held up to all the tasty drippings of my medium well patty and the gooey yolk of the fried egg. The bun was visually appealing too, with both black and white sesame seeds. \\n\\nThe burger, itself, was cooked to a perfect medium and as I cut it in half the egg yolk oozed into the bun. The sharp cheddar complemented the other big flavors nicely. It didn't disappear into the background, but didn't take over either.\\n\\nThe size of the burger was also perfect. Anything larger would have been overkill. Would have loved to try the fries and the soba salad, but there just wasn't room.\",\n",
       " \"GREAT burgers! Good service. And it doesn't break the bank! A solid 4 stars all around. \\n\\nI'm usually skeptical of gourmet burger joints just bc there are sooooo many out there now. A burger is a burger right? Well no not really. And BurGR proves that you can still make a piece of meat between two pieces of bread pretty unique. \\n\\nHubby and I tried the place out on a Thursday night about 6pm. We stayed at planet hollywood and every time we go by BurGR There always seems to be a line. But we were told 25 min and it really took us maybe 15 min in line. You can get in faster if you opt for one of the high top tables which are teeny but it'll do. Good view of the TV to catch some of the games.  I got the chanterelle burger which doesn't come with cheese but you can add on. I opted for Fontina cheese which worked great with the arugula, mushrooms and fig jam. My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious. What I like about the burgers are that they're not huge and unmanageable to eat. They fit nicely in the hands and are the perfect portion at least for us. \\n\\nThe truffle Parmesan fries. Very good. Not too truffle-y. We also had the jalepeno poppers which were delicious!! The floor mgr came to check on us and gave us a funny tidbit, that in each batch of poppers there's one where they leave the seeds. apparently  my hubby got that one bc he bit into it and felt like his face was on fire. But the poppers. I highly recommend them. They have bacon inside them, hello!!\\n\\nTo finish off our dinner we got the sticky toffee push pops which were delicious and just the right touch of sweetness to end your meal. Good beer on tap too. A nice solid place to grab a tasty meal and not go broke!! Good service too.\",\n",

Too much and we only ate a few. The burgers were ok, not as special as we had expected. If this would have been it then I would probably have ended this review with 3 stars.

I could not stop thinking about what had to be happening in these women's lives to make them take a job where they were so horribly objectified.

If you're standing an additional 4 people behind us, and we were told it would be 25 minute wait, i'm pretty sure you will have to wait even longer.\\n\\nIf you are a total rewards or diamond member however, you get preferred seating.  Unfortunately, i could not find my stupid card, and the only way you can use it is if you have in on hand. \\n\\nFood also took a good amount of time to come out... the couple sitting beside us didn't get their food until a good 15-20 minutes after we sat down.  Make sure you're not in a rush when you visit, just in case service is slow! \\n\\nWith that said, boyfriend and I were really excited about Burgr.  We started off with a Guinness and a Sierra Mist.  The only reason I even mention the Sierra Mist is because it's a Pepsi product, and a good majority of Vegas establishments use only Pepsi products, including Burgr :[  makes me super sad, as i'm all about Coca Cola.  But, moving on.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Britannia (English Cheddar, Mango Chutney, and Arugula) and the Chanterelle (Chanterelle mushrooms, argular, figgy onion jam).  Both pretty good, but also very alike.  The only huge difference we noted was the mushrooms.  Makes sense.  Both had the Arugula and both were slightly sweet from the chutney and the jam.  The meat was super juicy and cooked medium.  Melted right in your mouth!  Also, I've noticed comments on the size of the burgers.  Honestly, I only managed to eat a little more than half.  The burgers are pretty heavy, which makes you feel fuller faster than you normally would.  Of course the order of truffle fries that we shared probably added onto the fullness.  Best truffle fries ever!  I'm usually not a fan of steak fries, but man, these were crispy and delicious!\\n\\nI was really set on ordering a shake, but honestly, glad I didn't.  Had no room left for anything else, and was already feeling kind of sickly full.  All in all, for the 2 burgers, truffle fries, beer and soda our bill came out to about 55 (pre tip).  With tip we spent around 66ish  for 2.  Would definitely visit again!\",\n",

The toppings were good and the bun was meh.  Overall it wasn't a bad burger but it wasn't great either (and definitely not worth the money).  We ordered the parm fries and they were quite tasty but $8 for potatoes? Ouch.  I'm fairly certain they were not freshly cut like any decent fast dining burger joint (five guys, in-and-out burger, etc).\\n\\nThis is a marketing project masquerading as a restaurant with a celebrities name in the title.

My second visit, not so much.  \\n\\nThis restaurant has become very popular, and there is often a long line of people waiting to be seated.  We arrived at off-peak time on a Sunday afternoon, so the wait was only about 5 to 10 minutes.  The restaurant was nevertheless packed inside and on the loud side.  I could be mistaken, but there seemed to be more tables in the dining area than before. In any event, if you are not seated in a booth, you will be pretty close to the adjacent tables.  \\n\\nThe service during my first visit rivaled fine dining.  This time, the service was slow, infrequent, and unpolished.  It took too long for our server to make her appearance after we were seated.  She was soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the din of the crowded restaurant.  When I asked her what beers they have on tap, she appeared to me to be annoyed by my question and placed an iPad in front of me to peruse.  She took our order very mater of factly and was on her way.  \\n\\nIt must have taken 15 minutes for my beer to arrive, and that was about 10 minutes after my buddy\\'s diet coke was delivered by a staffer who informed us the beer he didn\\'t bring would be coming \"soon.\"   Some other guy eventually brought the beer.  \\n\\nIt took a good while longer for the food to come out.  I ordered my burger medium, but the burger I was served was well done.  I ate it without saying anything to avoid further annoyance to our server and because lord knows how long it would have taken to get a replacement.  \\n\\nWe were staying at the Encore, so having lunch here wasn\\'t exactly convenient.  Based on my first experience, the place seemed worth going out of my way for.  Based on my second visit, I might give it another chance, but I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to do it.',\n",
       " \"Great experience! Tasty burgers cooked perfectly, first time I've had duck bacon and it didn't disappoint. Exceptional service and delicious cocktails, definitely recommend as a must eat at spot in Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"It's was a pretty good burger but not worth the overall hype.   Definitely not worth the long wait I still feel bachi burger is better. \\n\\nThe fries were okay as well. But having to wait an hour to be seated and another hour to be served killed the experience.\",\n",
       " \"We've visited Ramsay BurGR enough times to say it's consistently good.\\n\\nAfter trying a few varieties of their burgers, my favorite is still the Britannia, because the mango chutney is an interesting complement to the rest of the sandwich.\\n\\nThe fries aren't always uniformly good throughout the basket, but enough of them are tasty that it's worth discarding a few squishy ones, and the two different dipping sauces are so much better than plain ketchup or mayo.\\n\\nThey have many drinks to choose from, so it's fun to pick out a new one each time.\\n\\nWe've been lucky on the service so far - during our last visit the waiter took the time to share a few ideas for which beer was good (we went with his recommendation of Magic Hat beer). They also have a practical system that lets any passing waiter at the chef's counter pick up an order and bring it out to the table so it doesn't get cold if our assigned waiter can't get to it right away.\\n\\nThere's usually a long line to get in, and we've been surprised a couple times to find more than a few empty tables when we're seated. Are they intentionally trying to make this place harder to get into, or are the hostesses just a little disorganized?\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend visiting with a large group. The wait is long enough as it is just for one or two people - bring more than that and you'll be waiting a good long while before you're seated.\\n\\nThe location is right off the casino floor, but we didn't smell any smoke while waiting in line. During the winter I always end up taking off my jacket while I'm in line, because the decorative flames in the front generate enough heat to stay warm.\\n\\nRecommended.\",\n",
       " \"AMAZing.. Each of us (5) ordered a different burger and each was amazing, couldn't decide which was our favorite! Fries were great too with 2 different sauces.\\nHighly recommend the whiskey lemonade drink!! :) best burger I have ever had\",\n",
       " 'By far onr of the best burgers I ate in Vegas. Their fries wings and onion rings are awesome. Euro Burger was delicious.',\n",
       " \"This is our newest favorite place to make sure we go when in Vegas. We haven't had a bad burger yet and thinking about going there makes my mouth water! The truffle fries are amazing, though the onion rings are pretty lackluster. That's ok because there is plenty else to order! Specialty cocktails are also great. Love it!\",\n",
       " \"Service was fantastic. Bar selection was far less than fantastic.\\n\\nThis place serves up a damned good burger. Nothing absolutely mind-blowing or amazing, but very unique, delicious flavors. \\n\\nI ordered the uber cheeseburger with a lettuce wrap (no bun). To be honest, the actual taste of the meat was somewhat disappointing. The quality just wasn't that great. But wow,  as soon as I took my first bite beyond the patty and into the land of Uber cheesy-ness, my tastebuds fell in love with Gordon Ramsay. There were three or four different kinds of cheeses, one was goat cheese -- I can't remember the others because I honestly didn't recognize them, but the combination was amazeballs. \\n\\nMy friends all loved their burgers (or Burgrs, is it?) as well. The farm burger had duck bacon and a fried egg -- I came realllllyy close to getting this one but passed it up.The fries were less than spectacular. As in, just meh. \\n\\nOverall, really great experience, especially for Vegas. They got 12 of us in in under 30 minutes on a Saturday night. It wasn't ridiculously pricey either, at least for vegas -- my burger was about $12-15. Considering how bad and badly overpriced the food is in Vegas is, this place is a must try if you're in town.\",\n",
       " \"Beer was good. We had the hop garden.... I think...? We sat at the bar. The bartenders were on top of it. Very present & helpful. Our burgers were amazing, I had the euro burger & my fiancé had the hog burger. Both were good. The fries were whatever. Didn't finish them which says something because fries are my weakness. Anyway, good burgers!\",\n",
       " \"I've been dying to go to this place ever since I moved to Vegas. I love Gordon Ramsey! The reason I hadn't gone sooner was the line. There's ALWAYS a line! However I had tickets to a museum close to the strip and needed to eat beforehand so I met up with some friends here at 11:10. The place opens at 11 so the tiny line there was moved quickly. I think we waited literally a minute. \\nThe drink menu is on an IPad which is ok I guess, didn't really see the point. I ordered a jalapeño Rita to start with. It took awhile for the drinks to come out I would say probably ten minutes for each one. I wasn't in any rush not to mention the company was good so it didn't bother me much but I could see how someone might get annoyed by the slow service. \\nWe ordered jalapeño poppers to start, unfortunately our request for ALL of the jalapeño poppers to be super spicy was denied (boo) so I had to settle for the roulette. My fiancé ended up getting the spiciest one (lucky guy!) but my god they were all tasty. Best jalapeño popper I ever had. \\nMy fiancé and I shared the chili dog and Hell's Kitchen Burger for lunch. I was expecting the burger to be spicy and it wasn't. It was so delicious though! Whatever seasoning was used in the meat was perfect, I could have just eaten the burger patty and been satisfied. The chili dog was also good too but it was HUGE and messy. \\nMy friend let me try some of her regular fries which were good. They came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, both were amazing. I'm not sure I can go back to regular ketchup ever again. I seriously considered asking the waiter how I could go about buying a bottle. I seriously would eat it with everything! \\nAll in all I think it took about two hours from the time we sat down until we got our change to eat which is a little more time than I usually spend in a restaurant. As stated earlier though I was with friends and catching up was nice. It is quite loud inside too so I had to almost yell to have a conversation but the tables are far enough away that you don't hear your neighbors conversation. \\nI would definitely come back, I saw some onion rings going around that looked absolutely divine!\",\n",
       " \"Don't submit to the hype.\\n\\nIt was an overrated (literally) restaurant. I had the Farm Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The burger was overly dry and bland. The fries were bland as well. Please salt the fries!\\n\\nGo for the experience, but not the food. The burger at Guy Fieri at the Quad was a lot better.\",\n",
       " 'Had a very good BurGR at BurGR. As good as it gets from a food quality perspective. The bun, the meat, the toppings, nothing out of place. Mine was perfectly cooked and basically flawless all around. To top it off, they even serve Pepsi products, so was able to enjoy it with a Mountain Dew! A few drawbacks. It was very pricey, mine was about $16 if I recall, and that does not include fries. Service was slow and nothing special. Finally, the atmosphere was cafeteria like, could be improved considerably. Despite the drawbacks, if you like a good burger, it is worth going to BurGR.',\n",
       " \"My First experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant (Gordon Ramsay Steak) was forgettable, so I hesitated to try another, but the great reviews on Yelp about Burger gave me the inspiration I needed to give it a try.  I have to report back that I should have trusted my own instincts instead of backing down to Yelp peer pressure. The restaurant is impressive looking, from the decor to the mini skirted waitstaff, but the food itself let me down.  Most of it was poorly cooked and or flavorless. My wife and I started our meal with beer battered Maui Onion Rings and these were actually the highlight of the meal for me. They come in a decent size portion for two people and I thought they were sweet and flavorful with a nice crunchy batter and a nice touch of Parmesan on top of them. They were served with a super thick but very good Cheddar Ranch Dip and an interesting but not great flavored smokey house Chipotle Ketchup. For her burger, Simone tried  a well done Chanterelle Burger with arugula, mushrooms and onion fig jam. At first bite you could taste the sweet onion jam and it was very good good but almost immediately it was overwhelmed by the taste of a burnt Burger. It was crunchy and definitely well done but in all the wrong ways and its texture was that of a dog biscuit.  I could not taste the mushroom at all.  The Burger was a waste of 16.00 dollars but after loading it up with as much of the jam as possible she reluctantly finished most of it anyways.  I ordered the famous Farm Burger medium and it was cooked correctly. It was topped with English Sharp Cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg. This Burger also had no flavor. The meat needed some kind (any kind) of seasoning, and although I could see the bacon I could not taste it. I have had more flavorful bacon from the local grocery store. I'm going to assume there was cheese on it because I could see that also but again no flavor.  The egg that was supposed to add a nice creamy richness did nothing to save this burger. I could have made this better at home and had it a lot cheaper and with seasoning. To try and save the meal we tried  the much talked about bread pudding lollipops. These were good but not great. They were fancy looking with there layers of bread pudding and Ice Cream but they were a little dry. To summarize this meal I would have to say it was overpriced for the lack of quality. In my experiences, it seems you are paying for the name on the wall when you eat at any of Gordon Ramsay's places. I have tried two of his restaurants and been let down twice by the sub par quality. I will not be trying a third time.\",\n",
       " \"Six ladies did some major damage here. 3.5 stars for a late afternoon linner.\\n\\nI won't harp much on what's already been reviewed, so in short:\\n\\nTruffle parmesan fries (X2 - thick cut, ample amounts of parmesan and truffle oil, and served with a side of ketchup and aioli).\\n\\nEuro burger (X2) with goat cheese, arugula, and roasted tomato. The goat cheese melded surprisingly well with the beef patty and didn't overwhelm the senses. The texture of the cheese was particularly smooth. The patties in these burgers were well done, not my preference, but were cooked as requested.\\n\\nBrittania burger (X2) with sharp cheddar and mango chutney. For those who like sweet and somewhat sour flavors that contrast (possibly in a good way) with the cheddar cheese. These patties were medium and medium rare, which came a bit more cooked than anticipated, but were well seasoned.\\n\\nA third burger, the name which escapes me (also X2) had duck bacon (leaner than pork bacon but had the smell of duck fat thoroughly infused!) and a fried egg (made the burger look luxurious sitting prettily on the patty). The buns for these (as were the buns for the other burgers) were soft on the inside but not particularly toasted on the outside.\\n\\nChicken soba noodle salad, which I'll elaborate more on as it's not reviewed much, was surprisingly refreshing. (There was no edamame in this dish, although the menu stated otherwise.) There were thin strips of green onion intermixed within the noodle, crushed peanuts, sprinkled sesame seeds, thin strips of carrots, and a few slices of avocado all tossed in a honey-peanut dressing (more savory than sweet, which was to my liking) and plated with 2 skewers of sriracha marinated chicken. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful, the heat not too strong so it was just a faint taste of the sriracha. (Still flavorful but not for the purpose of giving you lots of heat). This dish was particularly fitting for that humid afternoon.\\n\\nSticky toffee pudding push up pops (X2) had 2 pops per order. The dessert was fun to eat (literally like a push up pop as the name suggests) and the flavors and textures were very well balanced by interlacing layers of toffee (sticky and more congealed) and cream (airy and soft). \\n\\nWhile a worthwhile food adventure, the long wait and the fairly conservative play on the food probably won't be drawing me back any time too soon. But of course if ever in Vegas and in need of a burGR, you now have this on your radar.\",\n",
       " \"Everyone I come to Vegas this is a required stop for me & the bf. It's not just the food or the cool ambiance, even though there is large amounts of both. The best part about eating here is the excellent service. We've been here several times & have been helped by different servers every time. Our service has been flawless every time. Quick drinks & attentive service really help make this a great experience. \\n\\nPlease don't think it's just about the service though. I sometimes have dreams about the yumminess of the Farm Burger (my go to order). The jalapeño poppers are fantastic & the sides (fries/onion rings) are excellent. If you come here at lunchtime be prepared for a wait (there's a line outside the restaurant). You'll get seated faster coming in the late afternoon between normal lunch/dinner hours. \\n\\nThis is completely worth your time & is the most affordable of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas. Enjoy!\",\n",

I thought it was so nice of him to move me, especially when you know the lengths the line usually gets out the door!\\n\\nMy server, Amanda, was also really great.  She and another server kept coming by to make sure I had enough water and that I was taken care of.  Everything was so personalized and courteous, it felt like a special occasion!\\n\\nI ordered the Skinny Screw cocktail, American burger and their delicious sweet potato fries.  Those things are amazing!  They were a little overcooked so the dipping sauce and powdered sugar did double duty this time.\\nOverall, a very friendly atmosphere and outstanding service.',\n",
       " '5 stars from this yelper! I had the American Burger and truffle fries. It was absolutely the best burger I have ever had. There was a line but even though they said 30 minutes, it was actually 5. Service was quick and efficient. Definitely a must eat place while in Vegas!',\n",
       " \"Being a Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to try this place on a recent trip to Vegas.  I was worried it would be over-hyped, but I was pleasantly surprised. It took about 15 minutes to be seated for 2 people on a busy weekend night. Not bad at all. We started with the onion rings, and my god, they were incredible. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the flavors were awesome. We had the Hell's Kitchen and Chanterelle burgers. Definitely some of the best burgers I've ever had. Prices aren't terrible considering it's on the strip. Food arrived in a timely manner and our waitress was nice. Not horrible service, but not amazing either. I would definitely return here!\",\n",
       " \"I had really high expectations for BurGR, and while the meal was enjoyable I had to take down the rating a notch because of the horrible stomachache I had a couple hours after eating. I had the Euro burger, which included a roasted tomato, goat cheese, and arugula on top of the patty. I found the patty to be on the dry side, but the fixings were a fresh change. On the other hand, their truffle fries were really good as it was the first time I had truffle fries on thick-cut steak fries. My boyfriend also tried the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee, but while the Oreo portion was good, the creme brulee made the whole thing a little sickly sweet. In my opinion, Gordon Ramsay's name overhypes the place and you can definitely find better burgers in Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"This is the second time we've visited Burgr, and the first thing I'll say is that the quality and the presentation of the food was consistent. I'll share the highlights of our experience:\\n\\nPros-\\nThe food is exceptional. The most basic ideas were turned to a very intricate piece of art you can taste. Who knew cod could taste so good? The burgers speak for themselves. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with ornate decor. Presentation is well done also.\\n\\nCons- \\nBe prepared to wait a very long time. After ordering our food, we had a dragging 75 minutes before we got it. During which, a large group seated long after us received their order. Once it came, they didn't bring us an item we had ordered. We told the waiter, who never returned. When we mentioned it to someone else, they looked at the ticket and said that it looks like the person that took our order forgot to add them and that she'll get them for us. Even though we were halfway through our meal, they added that to our charge. We weren't very impressed about that part of our experience.\\n\\nEven though the accuracy and proper time frame was a little lacking, they were friendly and helpful, and The food was phenomenal.\",\n",

My friends were not thrilled about their burgers. I think the only decent burger was the Farm Burger with the duck bacon and fried egg.The fries came with two gourmet ketchups. I cannot remember one but I definitely remember the other. Don't get me wrong, I love indian food but this tomato + curry flavor was all wrong! I have had curry ketchup before but this one was not balanced.

We had the Hog burger and WOW, every bite was heavenly..juiciest burger ever, all the ingredients were delicious from the crisp onions to the slaw...effin amazing...my kids even made a song on how delicious it was and would not stop talking about the burger for 2 days...not 1 single complaint..resturaunt was very nice to look at, the staff was friendly and impressively knowledgeable of the menu, food was out of this world..luckily we were immediately seated because we were first there compared to the 1.5hr waits of the previous days..the restraunt packed after about 15 minutes of opening...so if you want to have a truly unique burger experience, i highly recommend this place...great job gordon!',\n",

It was a bit over priced.\\nI had Gordon Ramsey burger duck bacon, avocado, cheese. Truffle fries w house made ketchup tasted like marinara. The portion was good I cut the burger in half n couldn't finish it like 1/3 lb burger.\",\n",
       " 'I had researched this restaurant prior to visiting Las Vegas. And I must say it was exactly what I hoped it would be. I had the Euro burger which was phenomenal! They had 30 different beers on tap. And the drink menu was on an iPad. We started off with the truffle fries, Maui onion rings, and jalapeño poppers. Best appetizers by far. I had two servers who were outstanding which us why we left a very generous tip. The set up of the place is also very cool. I definitely recommend this place and wish there was one in Sacramento.',\n",
       " 'I can\\'t even tell you how much I loved this restaurant! I\\'m a diehard Gordon Ramsay fan and have vowed to eventually visit all of his restaurants around the world! Last visit in Vegas I went to Steak (which was mouth-wateringly delicious) and this time in Vegas I convinced a few friends of mine to come with me to have the best burGRs of their lives! It was my husband\\'s birthday and there was quite a wait but it didn\\'t even matter because of what was to come (plus your in the great planet hollywood resort and casino with tons to do while you wait). We started our meal off with the jalapeño poppers which were such a treat! You get six delicious jalapeño poppers and one of the six is a \"surprise\" (all of its stems and seeds, which create the heat, remain in the jalapeño). I was so excited to get the surprise jalapeño since my idol GR claims that the one who gets the surprise popper is the lucky one in Vegas. Nice personal touch! Moving on the star dish! I had the Euro BurGR and I usually like my meat medium but I took a risk and had medium rare as the chef recommends and it was something I do not regret in the least bit! It was the juiciest burGR I\\'ve ever had! All of the different elements and ingredients perfectly harmonized together. From the toasted black and white sesame seeds on top of the bun to the oven roasted tomato and goat cheese which added a zingy taste of heaven in my mouth. The arugula and truffle aioli were just the perfect touch to the perfect burGR. I also tried the uber cheese burGR which my husband had ordered and it was just as amazing. Gooey ooey cheese stretched for miles on end with every scrumptious bite. The onion rings were the perfect amount of crisp and came with amazing chipotle ketchup. This is definitely a place that I\\'d go back to the next time I\\'m in Vegas and I can\\'t wait for my final stop restaurant of Gordon Ramsay\\'s Pub & Grill! I really can\\'t wait to visit all of his restaurants eventually and maybe my fourth time in Vegas he\\'ll open another one! That would be phenomenal just like him and his success!',\n",

Fries are onion rings are strong as well. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was RAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. \\n\\nJk. It was very delicious, tender, and perfectly medium rare.

The server recommended a good beer pairing initially, but was not attentive throughout the rest of the dining experience.  $19 for my Gordon Ramsay burger was a joke.  It was good but nothing extraordinary.  A Carl's Junior burger easily could have beaten the burger I had.

Yelpers gave great review so we had to try Gordon Ramsey's burger! We ordered the hog burger, the classic american, the famous truffles fries, sweet potato fries, and sticky toffee pudding push pops. OMG! It was the best burger meal we ever had! Cooked perfectly. The dessert made me feel like a child again! Nostalgic feeling! Everything delicious!! Great service!! On our bill there is an iphone attached to the bill to do a survey.\",\n",
       " \"I really want to give BurGR 4.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me.  We visited in a group of 10 this past Friday night around 9pm, with no reservation.  I love restaurants, including BurGR, that will put your name on the list and text you when your table is ready, so you can roam around instead of hovering by the entrance.  We were quoted an hour and a half, but the wait only ended up being about 15 minutes.  Either way, we would have been fine because the lobby opens up into the Planet Hollywood casino, so we would have had no trouble entertaining ourselves.\\n\\nI am generally suspicious of celebrity chef-owned restaurants, because it seems that once they get a tv show, the chefs are not very involved in their restaurants.  Honestly, I would not have chosen BurGR had we not been traveling with a large group.  But I could not have been more pleasantly surprised with the quality of the experience.  Service, food and drinks were excellent and the prices are incredibly modest for a resort on the Strip.  $7 for a craft beer and $14 for a gourmet burger is in line with what we pay at good burger places at home.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I usually eat at independently owned restaurants, avoiding chains and touristy joints, and we were both very happy with our meal here.  I had a delicious jalapeño tequila cocktail and the Brittania burger.  He had an off-menu pork burger and a draft beer.  We split the truffle parmesan fries and one of the milkshakes.  My only criticism is that the truffle fries were not as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was still great.  \\n\\nThere is a lot of mediocre, overpriced food on the Las Vegas Strip, but BurGR was our best meal on the Strip in 3 days.  If I'm ever in town again, I'll be back!\",\n",

Both times we ordered the onion rings. My husband and I agreed that these were the best onion rings we'd ever had. They came with a cheddar ranch sauce for dipping which was out of this world. The burgers were really tasty also, and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the hot dog too, but honestly probably would have preferred a other burger! We also sampled the jalapeño poppers which my husband adored (I'm not big on spicy in general). You could tell that everything was fresh and homemade. Also, the service was awesome on both visits. Each table has a server and an assistant so there's always someone available if you need something. I will definitely return here next time I'm in Vegas!\",\n",

If u are a party of 2, you can wait in line to be seated which seemed to go by fast.

My dad on the other hand, had a *few* black & tans and (obviously) enjoyed them.\\nI ordered the Fish & Crisp burger and although it took 30 minutes to arrive and was ridiculously hard to eat, I really enjoyed it. The cod was nicely breaded and tasted really good with the tartar sauce and onion crisps. We shared the Maui onion rings and could not make it through half of them because we were so full.

Fish heavily overcooked in deep frier to the point that it's 50% non-edible crust and rest is overcooked fish.

Once inside the restaurant was very large inside and had a lot of seating. I got the opportunity to sit in front of the kitchen and watch how things are run. Service was excellent, the lady was very helpful and friendly on my first visit there. As for the food and size of the portions I'm very happy. I had an off the menu burger properly named the Gordon Ramsay burger, along with the parmesan truffle fries. The price for the burger was 18 dollars and the price for the fries was 11 dollars. The burger was absolutely fantastic to the palate. In addition the truffle fries came with a truffle aïoli which was also very good. Although this may seem very costly I thought the quality of food and the portions was very fitting. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very nice. If you're ever in Vegas and want to grab a burger for lunch or dinner Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a place to consider.\",\n",

The wait staff are very friendly and good looking... Eating utensils are pretty nifty as well. Your knives stand up! Great experience, awesome food, and a very tasty expensive burger. The only thing my group agreed on was that the burger wasn't big enough... It is like a kids bun. \\n\\nDef a hit! And you can keep the menu of you want a souvenir.\",\n",

I couldn't finish it all but I have dreams about that burger still. \\n\\nThe very best part of my visit was the gooey fries. I literally could not stop eating them. The fries had a perfect crispness to them, the cheese was phenomenal, the salami was a nice savory touch and the over easy egg on top was the crowning glory. \\n\\nI would eat at this restaurant for my whole vacation if I could. \\n\\nBest burger in Vegas, best fries in the country.

This past weekend, my friends and I were in Sin City for a birthday celebration and we decided to try the newly opened BurGR.  I'm not even slightly exaggerating when I say that the Farmhouse Burger that I ate at Gordon's new restaurant is the best burger I've ever eaten in my life.  Perfectly seasoned beef topped with Duck Bacon (which I didn't even know existed), French Cheddar, and a gooey fried egg....it was like eating a piece of art.\\n\\nIn addition to the burger, my friends and I shared some truffle parmesan french fries with BurGR's homemade truffle aioli and ketchup sauces (both amazing).  We also ordered creme brulee oreo milkshakes (best milkshake I've ever had).  The only dish that we ordered that I was less than ecstatic about was the honeypig bao buns appetizer...but honestly, the rest of the meal was so amazing, we completely forgot about it.\\n\\nAt a fairly reasonable price for Ramsay level quality food, I highly recommend trying out BurGR next time you're at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Las Vegas.\",\n",

LOL!).  :) No, really...I couldn't really find anything bad about my experience here...it would be a hamburger lovers dream! \\n\\nThe good:  Their vegetarian option was awesome!  A delish portabello mushroom burger.  Yummy goodness.  I enjoyed every bite!  I'm guessing some people might not like mushrooms, though.  :) I even took a bite of my friend's burger (Yes! I know it is red meat! I had to see if it was worth getting sick for!).  If I weren't going to be out for the night and if I wanted to deal with an upset tummy - I would've gotten the burger despite swearing off red meat!  It was amazing - flavorful, moist and yummy.  Yes, all that from one bite. My other friend got the soba noodle chicken salad and she enjoyed it.  Now the fries - if you don't do the burger just go for the fries!  I love truffled anything and those fries were AHHHMAAAAZZZINNG!  We ordered one order of truffle fries and one of sweet potato fries and we couldn't even finish them all ( there were 3 of us).

The Jalapeno's had a good taste but no warning about them being boiling hot and they seemed fried within an inch of their lives too.  \\n\\nI traded my Mangalista for my partners Hell's Kitchen Burger* asadero cheese + roasted jalapeños + avocado + oven roasted tomatoes + jalapeño pesto aioli and was able to eat that but again it was off it seemed like I was eating a fajita burger the tomato was soggy as was the burger.\",\n",

It tasted like they were infused with bleu cheese which made it a truly perfect bite. We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro Burger. The Hell's kitchen was decent...the meat seemed to lack a bit of flavor but I did enjoy the flavor of the jalapenos and avocado the burger. The Euro burger was very good (better than the Hell's Kitchen)...the goat cheese was a perfect mix. \\n\\nIf you're in vegas, burgr is a must try..burgers are above average..wings are CRAZY good. 4 stars based on the wings alone.\",\n",
       " 'Just incredible. I had the \"earth burger\" and sweet potato fries - both are just excellent.  The mushroom burger was clearly inspired - the bread was incredibly fresh and perfectly toasted.  The sauces and cheeses were perfectly heated in a way that brought out the oils.  The mushroom wasn\\'t heavy on the balsamic vinegar, perfectly flavorful and not overwhelming.   The fries came nicely sweetened with sugar - not too sweet, and it didn\\'t over power the natural yam taste.  Apparently the ketchup is made in the store - it\\'s interesting.  The only perhaps weird part is the fries also came with a lemon meringue dip - I didn\\'t have much after a few exploratory swipes.',\n",

Thought it would be great because of the long line but that wasn't true.

I like them all, except the belly pockets were just two small pockets (same size as those pizza rolls you buy in the frozen section). $12 for two small rolls- not worth it.\\nLoved the gooey fries and the truffle fries.

Unfortunately, this place does not take any reservations but since I am a platinum member with total rewards I didn\\'t have to wait what so ever. I had the truffle burger made \"medium\" and I must say it was delicious! That word isn\\'t even enough to describe how good it was! We also got the \"gooey fries\" and the \"truffle fries\". They were both very good but very filling. The waiters and waitresses were also very friendly and nice and gave some great selections on what beers to pick from. I ended up getting the innis gun since the waiter reccomended that with the burger and it went with it very well! I will be back here next time for sure. Maybe for lunch so we can try some of the more extravagant p[laces for dinner.\\nP.S. Make reservations on New Years Eve if you would like to have some good food.',\n",

On the burgers don't come any condiments so they dipping sauce they gave me for the fries, I used for my burger lol. It was so good. They give you a shaker of sugar for your fries and I must of used it all up. The only thing I didn't enjoy much was the shake. It just didn't taste any different than a regular chocolate shake I had at any other restaurant. \\n\\nI had to get a to-go box because it was to much to handle.

       " \"Wow, just great burgers. We stopped in for lunch, got seated inside 10 minutes, and our order was taken right away. My wife and son both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, the roasted tomatoes on it made the taste. I had the Hogs burger which was great too. We shared a Caesar salad in the side, slices of apple and a nice dressing made it a great side. Our waiter Greg was really helpful, got our order in quick and our check right away as we had time constraints. Would absolutely go again.\",\n",
       " 'A burger is a burger is a  burger, and I\\'ll always be hard pressed to believe that any burger joint can offer a \"fine dining\" experience. Gordon Ramsay BurGR understands this, and while a meal there is not \"fine dining\", it is most definitely \"fun dining\".\\n\\nI\\'ve visited twice already. Once to sample the burgers and then a second time, because the crazy list of appetizers and sweet treats on the menu caught my eye and lulled me to come back sooner than later. Both visits were a hit.\\n\\nThe menu  is clean and simple and offers eight burgers and three \"dawgs\" as mains. There are also three burgers that come \"stacked\" with a meat patty and a meaty extra like shaved prosciutto or duck bacon. \\n\\nI had the delicious Char Siu Burger served with a beef patty and a slice of roasted pork belly, cucumber, radish, cilantro and a honey-hoisin sauce. The Asian-inspired extras were a nice touch, but the star was the medium rare beef patty that was succulent and juicy, and one of the best burgers I have had on the strip.\\n\\nThe missus ordered the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg that was smothered with roasted fresno peppers, jalapenos, and a touch of chipotle ketchup. This was also a smash and was so much better than the hot dogs served next door at Pinks.\\n\\nOn our second trip in almost as many days we tackled the \"snacks\" section of the menu and tried three of the six appetizers. \\n\\nThe Fury Chicken Wings play off the Hell\\'s Kitchen theme that is somewhat overly branded here, with flame decals popping up everywhere. The wings are served eight to a plate -- four tangy hot Buffalo style wings that again proved to be superior to most pub wings I have had, and four honey wasabi wings that provided a different flavor profile and fondly reminded me of the Shanghai Wings once served at a now defunct restaurant in Montreal that was my go-to spot for wings and things.\\n\\nWe also indulged in the four Five Spice Chicken Sliders that were breaded with Cornflakes and were kind of like yummy mini schnitzels in a bun. And while the spices and siracha mayo gave them some kick, I felt they did not need the cheddar cheese melted underneath. That said, I would love to see a BIGGER version of this burger added to the mains.\\n\\nThe Honey-Pig Bao Buns were just OK, and this was really the only miss on our second evening simply because we have had better elsewhere. While I liked the addition of pork belly on my burger, it was a bit too much of a good thing and slightly tough on its own, but that did not stop us from finishing it.\\n\\nThe menu also features two specialty fries that we tried on different nights. I preferred the Truffle Parmesan Fries that were crunchy and doused with liberal amounts of shredded parmesan, while the missus liked the Sweet Potato Fries that included a honey jalapeno mayo and vanilla powdered sugar as a condiment. This will definitely be a problem on a future visit as each portion is more than enough for two, so I hope they add a sampler of some kind to the menu that lets guests indulge in both styles.\\n\\nSpeaking of two people, I have to give props to the our two servers (both named Alex) who made some wonderful suggestions after listening to our tastes, and made us feel so incredibly welcome. We cut past the 30-minute wait on both nights by opting to sit at the back counter that offers an open view of the kitchen, and is where both Alexi (my pluralization of Alex) can be found dashing back and forth as they place orders and pick up plates. Yet not matter how busy they were in that very controlled kitchen chaos, they always popped past us to chat for a couple of seconds, check up with us, and almost made it feel like were were attending a very busy dinner party at a friend\\'s place. What\\'s more, while Alex 2 was our principle server on our second night, Alex 1 acknowledged our return visit and engaged us in conversation while Alex 2 was away working the front of the house. \\n\\nThey also introduced us to Benji, BurGR\\'s evil genius of all things beer, who made some great suggestions and introduced us to the wonderful apricot flavors of Magic Hat #9 after carefully consider of our tastes in ales and Belgian beers.       \\n\\nI also managed to down one of the five \"sugar fix\" shakes with my appetizers. I opted for Shake #5 following Alex 2\\'s suggestion that its Nutella like composition of chocolate hazelnut pudding and some coffee ice cream had to be tasted to be believed. Oh so decadent! I believe!\\n\\nNothing completes a meal like a great dessert and the über fun Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops, served to us with a smattering of Alex 2\\'s nostalgic impersonation of Bill Cosby shilling for Jell-O and arguing with wife Camille, were simply to die for. \\n\\nWe took these babies to go and I felt like I was in Lord of the Rings. These pops mesmerized all those who saw them. \"That looks so so good,\" strangers said hoping to covet them, but there was NO WAY we were going to share this pretty precious delicious dessert. MY precious pudding push up pops!',\n",
       " \"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I heard it opened.  Honestly......it was ok.  Not what I expected from Gordon Ramsey.  I had the American burger and onion rings.  \\n\\nThe burger was cooked medium just as I ordered it. The meat was nicely seasoned. The lettuce, tomato and onions were all very fresh.  The pickled (bread and butter type) were also very good.  While the burger tasted very good it wasn't anything special.\\n\\nAs for the onion rings.....they were way too greasy!!!  I liked the dipping sauces that came with it.  \\n\\nAll in all, I would not put this on my list of places to return to. :(\",\n",
       " \"BurGR is great!  It would be very easy for this place to just coast on Gordon Ramsey's name and its location but thankfully they don't.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I want to come back and try more.  I tried the Gordon burger which has a pork patty, duck bacon, avocado, and other tasty things I can't remember.  You may be skeptical of a pork patty but it works and the first bite I took was heavenly.  My husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious.  We both agreed that the beef patty wins out over the pork patty, but both of them are so good.  Our friends also loved their burgers.  We also shared sweet potato fries and onion rings; super delish!  In addition to the food, the service was pretty good.  There are so many options in Vegas that it's really easy to not return to the same place twice but I really want to come back here again.\",\n",

Which does not make sense in anyway. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen and the farm burger and sweet potato fries. Again burger was sooo salty. We loved the sauce of the sweet potato fries but the fries were half soggy and half crispy. ::sigh::: I wanted to like this place so much...I m just so disappointed. HIGHLY not recommended but you guys will try it anyways. :)\",\n",

My bf got the Gordon Ramsay burger which is not on the menu and I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. The meat wasn't juicy and the burger in general was flavorless. We also got the Onion Rings which were probably the best part of the meal and the Jalapeño Poppers which were spicy AF!! I'm Mexican and can take heat and I couldn't take it. Idk if they were a bad batch or what but they were super spicy! The wait on a Sunday at 2pm was 40 mins for a table for two. $60 and 2hrs later, totally disappointed!\",\n",

I ordered the Damnation Chicken burger and was surprised with a juicy ground chicken burger. While it was not as spicy as I would have liked, the carrot celery slaw was perfectly crunchy and the blue cheese was rich and creamy. Definitely a winner. My boyfriend had the American burger and was blown away with the simple awesomeness.\\nWe chose to order the regular fries which come with curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup, both amazingly good. I put the chipotle ketchup on my burger as well. In retrospect, I would have definitely ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. An order went by us and looked amazing.\\nI wasn't feeling dessert, but the milkshakes and other desserts that went by looked like they were straight out of the menu pictures. They also provide you with a tablet that has the drink menus and some of the cocktails looked very interesting. The beers were $6/$7 which was cheaper than any casino bar. Overall it was a great food experience, but the service was a letdown. Don't let that deter you, though. Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"Thought we would try Gordon Ramsey's place in PH called BurGR. We had to wait about 40 min to get a table for two but it is a Saturday afternoon in Vegas after all. Atmosphere is cool and they have a lot of different kinds of burgers to order. Food looks good but everything is alacarte, I had to order fries since they don't come with the burgers. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger which has roasted jalapeño, avocado, cheese and a jalapeño aioli. Bun is very soft and tasted homemade the meat was cook perfectly and had great flavor, and with the roasted jalapeño it has just a bit of heat and the avocado cools it down. Service was good and our waiter Garrett always checked in. My wife ordered the Fury chicken wings and they were not very good. They were a bit dry and not real flavorful. The French fries were horrible and not good either we sat by the kitchen so I could see the food coming up and it appeared they make the fries way ahead of time and then they sit under heat lamps. Gordon Ramsey you need to change that!!! \\nGo for the burgers not the fries or wings\\nI am giving a good rating but it is ONLY for the burgers and sdefinitely and not the other food. If the burger wasn't good I would have only rated as one star.\",\n",
       " \"This place definitely lives up to Yelp expectations! I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and I have wanted to try this place for sooooo long. I was surprised they don't take reservations, but it is okay because it is more than worth the wait. I noticed the line is much longer for parties of 2 (I'm not too sure why), but we were a group of 3 so around 2:00 the wait for us was only 5 minutes thankfully! \\n\\nThe set up is very trendy and you can see the casino from the restaurant. I loved the fire designs going around the restaurant, they were very cool.\\n\\nSo so many different burger options. The best part is, you can make any burger with the vegetarian portobello patty or a turkey burger patty. I got the euro burger replaced with the portobello patty and added avocado. The burger was delicious and made with amazing quality. However, I was surprised to see it is $4 to add only a few slices of avocado in a burger (I guess that's what you get for being in a Vegas casino). The truffle fries were delicious and I recommend them to anyone who loves their fair share of garlic and truffle :) \\n\\nI will be back here many many times in the future and I recommend this yummy restaurant!\",\n",
       " 'HOLY CRAP Ramsay you did not disappoint me! Everytime I look at the pictures of the burger I ate here, I get so hungry and can still taste every bite of it. This is how food should be people!\\n\\nWe were hungry after watching a Cirque du Soleil show at Aria and debated between Holsteins, Ramsay\\'s, or Bachi Burger. Being that it was really late when we got outta the show (around 10pmish?) We didn\\'t wanna drive off the strip, so it was between Holstein\\'s and Ramsay\\'s. To be honest when I browsed the menu at GR\\'s through my yelp app, nothing stood out compared to Holstein\\'s. I guess that\\'s the magic and how you truly know a restaurant is good. Rather than advertising like crazy with \"kobe beef this organic that blah blah\" Ramsay\\'s menu was short & simple. No rants and raves about how or where their meat and food are sourced, yet the beauty is still presented in the food.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located inside PH, but it\\'s on the outer edge toward the strip, you can\\'t miss the sign near Pink\\'s Hot Dogs and the stairs. When we arrived we didn\\'t have to wait at all, maybe 10 mins max. I loved the open kitchen and we were lucky to get a table near it so we could see the chefs do their thang. The menu was cute & simple with a picture of Ramsay. Our server was such a nice guy I forgot his name, but I think he might be the manager? He gave us a run down of all the items and even let us browse the ipad for their different shakes etc.\\n\\nNOW ON TO THE GOOD STUFF:\\n\\nI was debating between Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger & Farm Burger, but the server was nice enough to let me know he could place the order for Hell\\'s Kitchen Burger and just add the duck breast bacon with egg for me. WELL HOT DAYUM thank you! It was the best creation ever made. I swear they should make it a permanent menu item. The burger was a perfect blend with the roasted jalapeno peppers, duck breast bacon, and fried egg. OMG dat fried egg!! If you see my pic http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6aMGpHWfe9vlUMfwPj5uMA/l.jpg it\\'s cooked perfectly with the yolk running beautifully after a slight pat down on the bun. I LOVED the duck breast bacon as well. It was crispy and tasted better than regular bacon YEAH THAT\\'S RIGHT I SAID IT. It wasn\\'t greasy like most bacon would be. The avocado fan on the burger was ripe & buttery smooth as it should be. The heat from the jalapeno didn\\'t overpower the burger, it gave the perfect kick to it. Honestly this burger was definitely worth the price!! The patties are a good size and juicy, it will fill you up. Also, I ordered mine medium rare and that\\'s exactly what was delivered, I hate when burger places make the burger too dry or overcook the outside. Normally I get burgers protein style, but it\\'s vegas so my diet did not exist and glad I got the buns cause they were soft yet toasted nicely :)\\n\\nChanterelle Burger - My friend ordered this w/ a double patty and I got a bite, but it was just average for me. Perhaps it was cause I ate my amazing burger creation first LOL. His patties were both cooked to perfect medium rare as well and was juicy. I liked the figgy jam they used with this burger as it added sweetness and complemented the mushrooms.\\n\\nTruffle Parmesan Fries - GOOD STUFF! Plenty of shredded truffle parmesan & the aioli was good, but I thought these fries tasted better w/ their curry ketchup. What I love best about these fries is the fact that it was thick cut and NOT SOGGY!! Each fry was crispy on the outside yet fluffy inside which is how it should be!\\n\\nSweet Potato Fries - Again not one fry was soggy & I really loved the flavors they mixed w/ the fries. The vanilla powdered sugar added sweetness w/out making it feel like sugar overload. The honey jalapeno mayo was a great dip for the fries as well. Highly recommend if you\\'re a sweet potato fan\\n\\nHoney-Pig Bao Buns - The server/manager guy that we talked to was such a sweetheart and hooked this up for us for free!! Love this guy he even gave me a free GR pen lol. Customer service at its finest. These were basically like the typical roast pork buns you see at chinese restaurants, but w/ Ramsay\\'s twist. It was different than what I\\'m used to cause instead of plum sauce, they used honey-hoisin. The buns were soft and pork belly was fatty, but good.\\n\\nPlanet Hollywood sure knows how to choose which restaurants are best to be in their casino. First Earl\\'s of Sandwich and now GR BURGR!! I wanted to buy a shirt, but they didn\\'t have my size :( I seriously am planning another vegas trip just so I can eat here again LOL. A lot of the tables ordered their shakes and it looked really good, but I was way too full to give it a try. Now that I\\'m back in Cali, I keep trying to find a burger place that will match what I ate at GR\\'s, but have had no luck. BTW get a total rewards card! You\\'ll get a discount on the food',\n",
